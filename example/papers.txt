Since the Nobel Prize award more than twenty years ago for discovering the core
apoptotic pathway in C. elegans, apoptosis and various other forms of regulated
cell death have been thoroughly characterized by researchers around the world.
Although many aspects of regulated cell death still remain to be elucidated in
specific cell subtypes and disease conditions, many predicted that research into 
cell death was inexorably reaching a plateau. However, this was not the case
since the last decade saw a multitude of cell death modalities being described,
while harnessing their therapeutic potential reached clinical use in certain
cases. In line with keeping research into cell death alive, francophone
researchers from several institutions in France and Belgium established the
French Cell Death Research Network (FCDRN). The research conducted by FCDRN is at
the leading edge of emerging topics such as non-apoptotic functions of apoptotic 
effectors, paracrine effects of cell death, novel canonical and non-canonical
mechanisms to induce apoptosis in cell death-resistant cancer cells or regulated 
forms of necrosis and the associated immunogenic response. Collectively, these
various lines of research all emerged from the study of apoptosis and in the next
few years will increase the mechanistic knowledge into regulated cell death and
how to harness it for therapy.

BACKGROUND: Cabbage white butterflies (Pieris spp.) can be severe pests of
Brassica crops such as Chinese cabbage, Pak choi (Brassica rapa) or cabbages (B. 
oleracea). Eggs of Pieris spp. can induce a hypersensitive response-like
(HR-like) cell death which reduces egg survival in the wild black mustard (B.
nigra). Unravelling the genetic basis of this egg-killing trait in Brassica crops
could improve crop resistance to herbivory, reducing major crop losses and
pesticides use. Here we investigated the genetic architecture of a HR-like cell
death induced by P. brassicae eggs in B. rapa.
RESULTS: A germplasm screening of 56 B. rapa accessions, representing the genetic
and geographical diversity of a B. rapa core collection, showed phenotypic
variation for cell death. An image-based phenotyping protocol was developed to
accurately measure size of HR-like cell death and was then used to identify two
accessions that consistently showed weak (R-o-18) or strong cell death response
(L58). Screening of 160 RILs derived from these two accessions resulted in three 
novel QTLs for Pieris brassicae-induced cell death on chromosomes A02 (Pbc1), A03
(Pbc2), and A06 (Pbc3). The three QTLs Pbc1-3 contain cell surface receptors,
intracellular receptors and other genes involved in plant immunity processes,
such as ROS accumulation and cell death formation. Synteny analysis with A.
thaliana suggested that Pbc1 and Pbc2 are novel QTLs associated with this trait, 
while Pbc3 also contains an ortholog of LecRK-I.1, a gene of A. thaliana
previously associated with cell death induced by a P. brassicae egg extract.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first genomic regions associated with the
Pieris egg-induced HR-like cell death in a Brassica crop species. It is a step
closer towards unravelling the genetic basis of an egg-killing crop resistance
trait, paving the way for breeders to further fine-map and validate candidate
genes.

BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cell communication
and the pathogenesis of some diseases. EVs may accelerate cell death during the
course of mycobacterial infection and are also considered as a new vaccine
design, drug delivery, and biomarker candidates. The current study evaluates the 
effects of EVs from serum samples of mycobacteria-infected patients on THP-1
monocytes and PBMC cells.
METHOD: EVs were purified from the serum, then cultured separately with THP-1
monocytes and PBMCs. The cell death was determined through annexin V-FITC and PI 
staining. GW4869, an EVs inhibitor, was used to determine if EVs released from
serum could increase THP-1 monocytes cell death.
RESULTS: The cell death was significantly increased in the presence of 10 µg/ml
and 5 µg/ml concentrations of the purified EVs (p < 0.05). Minimal cell death was
determined in 2.5 µg/ml and 1.2 µg/ml (p < 0.05). Up to 85% of the cells were
viable in the presence of the GW4869 inhibitor (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Direct infection of the cells with EVs released from
mycobacteria-infected patients samples, the multiplicity of infection with the
EVs, and virulent or avirulent mycobacteria may change the status of the cell
death. The isolated EVs  from serum samples of patients with mycobacterial
 infection accelerated cell death, which means that they might   not be
considered as an optimal tool for developing drug delivery and vaccine against
tuberculosis.

Programmed cell death plays a crucial role in plant development and disease
defense. Here, we report that the expression of StERF3, a potato EAR
motif-containing transcription factor, promotes Phytophthora infestans
colonization in Nicotiana benthamiana. Transient overexpression of StERF3 induces
cell death in N. benthamiana leaves. The substitution of two key amino acids
(14th and 19th) in its ERF domain (the DNA binding domain) dramatically altered
its cell death-inducing ability. In addition, StERF3△EAR EAR motif-deletion or
StERF3AAA mutation abolished the cell death-inducing ability. StERF3 interacted
with the co-repressors Topless-related protein 1 (StTPL1) and Topless-related
protein 3 (StTPL3) via the EAR motif. Moreover, cell death induced by StERF3 was 
facilitated by co-expression with StTPL1 or StTPL3. Virus-induced gene silencing 
(VIGS) of NbTPL1 and NbTPL3 in N. benthamiana compromised the cell death-inducing
ability of StERF3. Furthermore, StERF3-induced cell death accompanied with ROS
bursts and the upregulation of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) genes
NbRbohA and NbRbohC. In addition, several cell death regulator genes, including
NbCRTD, NbNCBP, and NbBCPL, and a hypersensitive cell death marker gene Hin1 were
upregulated. StERF3 may positively regulate cell death through its EAR
motif-mediated transcriptional repressor activity by inhibiting the expression of
genes potentially coding the repressor of cell death (CD).

BACKGROUND: The number of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
is rapidly increasing due to the growing epidemic of obesity. Non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), the inflammatory stage of NAFLD, is characterized by
lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, chronic inflammation and hepatocyte cell
death. Scopoletin and umbelliferone are coumarin-like molecules and have
antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects. Cytoprotective effects of
these compounds have not been described in hepatocytes and the mechanisms of the 
beneficial effects of scopoletin and umbelliferone are unknown.
AIM: To investigate whether scopoletin and/or umbelliferone protect hepatocytes
against palmitate-induced cell death. For comparison, we also tested the
cytoprotective effect of scopoletin and umbelliferone against bile acid-induced
cell death.
METHODS: Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to palmitate (1 mmol/L) or the
hydrophobic bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA; 50 μmol/L). Apoptosis
was assessed by caspase-3 activity assay, necrosis by Sytox green assay, mRNA
levels by qPCR, protein levels by Western blot and production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) by fluorescence assay.
RESULTS: Both scopoletin and umbelliferone protected against palmitate and
GCDCA-induced cell death. Both palmitate and GCDCA induced the expression of ER
stress markers. Scopoletin and umbelliferone decreased palmitate- and
GCDCA-induced expression of ER stress markers, phosphorylation of the cell death 
signaling intermediate JNK as well as ROS production.
CONCLUSION: Scopoletin and umbelliferone protect against palmitate and bile
acid-induced cell death of hepatocytes by inhibition of ER stress and ROS
generation and decreasing phosphorylation of JNK. Scopoletin and umbelliferone
may hold promise as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of NAFLD.

pathogens.

Tennessee.

The coevolution of host-pathogen interactions underlies many human physiological 
traits associated with protection from or susceptibility to infections. Among the
mechanisms that animals utilize to control infections are the regulated cell
death pathways of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Over the course of
evolution these pathways have become intricate and complex, coevolving with
microbes that infect animal hosts. Microbes, in turn, have evolved strategies to 
interfere with the pathways of regulated cell death to avoid eradication by the
host. Here, we present an overview of the mechanisms of regulated cell death in
Animalia and the strategies devised by pathogens to interfere with these
processes. We review the molecular pathways of regulated cell death, their roles 
in infection, and how they are perturbed by viruses and bacteria, providing
insights into the coevolution of host-pathogen interactions and cell death
pathways.

Unicellular eukaryotes have been suggested as undergoing self-inflicted
destruction. However, molecular details are sparse compared with the mechanisms
of programmed/regulated cell death known for human cells and animal models. Here,
we report a molecular cell death pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leading to
vacuole/lysosome membrane permeabilization. Following a transient cell death
stimulus, yeast cells die slowly over several hours, consistent with an ongoing
molecular dying process. A genome-wide screen for death-promoting factors
identified all subunits of the AP-3 complex, a vesicle trafficking adapter known 
to transport and install newly synthesized proteins on the vacuole/lysosome
membrane. To promote cell death, AP-3 requires its Arf1-GTPase-dependent vesicle 
trafficking function and the kinase Yck3, which is selectively transported to the
vacuole membrane by AP-3. Video microscopy revealed a sequence of events where
vacuole permeability precedes the loss of plasma membrane integrity.
AP-3-dependent death appears to be conserved in the human pathogenic yeast
Cryptococcus neoformans.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was discovered more than 100 years ago. Since then,
many protocols and agents for PDT have been proposed for the treatment of several
types of cancer. Traditionally, cell death induced by PDT was categorized into
three types: apoptosis, cell death associated with autophagy, and necrosis.
However, with the discovery of several other regulated cell death modalities in
recent years, it has become clear that this is a rather simple understanding of
the mechanisms of action of PDT. New observations revealed that cancer cells
exposed to PDT can pass through various non-conventional cell death pathways,
such as paraptosis, parthanatos, mitotic catastrophe, pyroptosis, necroptosis,
and ferroptosis. Nowadays, immunogenic cell death (ICD) has become one of the
most promising ways to eradicate tumor cells by activation of the T-cell adaptive
immune response and induction of long-term immunological memory. ICD can be
triggered by many anti-cancer treatment methods, including PDT. In this review,
we critically discuss recent findings on the non-conventional cell death
mechanisms triggered by PDT. Next, we emphasize the role and contribution of ICD 
in these PDT-induced non-conventional cell death modalities. Finally, we discuss 
the obstacles and propose several areas of research that will help to overcome
these challenges and lead to the development of highly effective anti-cancer
therapy based on PDT.

PURPOSE: This study assesses human biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, safety
and tumour uptake of cell death indicator labelled with 68Ga ([68Ga]Ga-CDI), a
novel radiopharmaceutical that can image multiple forms of cell death.
METHODS: Five participants with at least one extracranial site of solid
malignancy > 2 cm and no active cancer treatment in the 8 weeks prior to the
study were enrolled. Participants were administered 205 ± 4.1 MBq (range,
200-211 MBq) of [68Ga]Ga-CDI and 8 serial PET scans acquired: the first
commencing immediately and the last 3 h later. Participants were monitored for
clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographic side effects and adverse events.
Urine and blood radioactivity was measured. Spherical volumes of interest were
drawn over tumour, blood pool and organs to determine biodistribution and
calculate dosimetry. In one participant, tumour specimens were analysed for cell 
death using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)
staining.
RESULTS: [68Ga]Ga-CDI is safe and well-tolerated with no side effects or adverse 
events. [68Ga]Ga-CDI is renally excreted, demonstrates low levels of physiologic 
uptake in the other organs and has excellent imaging characteristics. The mean
effective dose was 2.17E - 02 ± 4.61E - 03 mSv/MBq. It images constitutive tumour
cell death and correlates with tumour cell death on histology.
CONCLUSION: [68Ga]Ga-CDI is a novel cell death imaging radiopharmaceutical that
is safe, has low radiation dosimetry and excellent biodistribution and imaging
characteristics. It has potential advantages over previously investigated
radiopharmaceuticals for imaging of cell death and has progressed to a
proof-of-concept trial.

Most anticancer treatments trigger tumor cell death through apoptosis, where
initiation of proteolytic action of caspase protein is a basic need. But under
certain circumstances, apoptosis is prevented by the apoptosis inhibitor
proteins, survivin and Hsp70. Several drugs focusing on classical programmed
death of the cell have been reported to have low anti-tumorogenic potency due to 
mutations in proteins involved in the caspase-dependent programmed cell death
with intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. This review concentrates on the role of
anti-cancer drug molecules targeting alternative pathways of cancer cell death
for treatment, by providing a molecular basis for the new strategies of novel
anti-cancer treatment. Under these conditions, active agents targeting
alternative cell death pathways can be considered as potent chemotherapeutic
drugs. Many natural compounds and other small molecules, such as inorganic and
synthetic compounds, including several repurposing drugs, are reported to cause
caspase-independent cell death in the system. However, few molecules indicated
both caspase-dependent as well caspase-free cell death in specific cancer lines. 
Cancer cells have alternative methods of caspase-independent programmed cell
death which are equally promising for being targeted by small molecules. These
small molecules may be useful leads for rational therapeutic drug design, and can
be of potential interest for future cancer-preventive strategies.

Mitochondrial disruption leads to the release of cytochrome c to activate
caspase-9 and the downstream caspase cascade for the execution of apoptosis.
However, cell death can proceed efficiently in the absence of caspase-9 following
mitochondrial disruption, suggesting the existence of caspase-9-independent cell 
death mechanisms. Through a genome-wide siRNA library screening, we identified a 
network of genes that mediate caspase-9-independent cell death, through ROS
production and Alox5-dependent membrane lipid peroxidation. Erk1-dependent
phosphorylation of Alox5 is critical for targeting Alox5 to the nuclear membrane 
to mediate lipid peroxidation, resulting in nuclear translocation of cytolytic
molecules to induce DNA damage and cell death. Consistently, double knockouts of 
caspase-9 and Alox5 in mice, but not deletion of either gene alone, led to
significant T cell expansion with inhibited cell death, indicating that
caspase-9- and Alox5-dependent pathways function in parallel to regulate T cell
death in vivo. This unbiased whole-genome screening reveals an
Erk1-Alox5-mediated pathway that promotes membrane lipid peroxidation and nuclear
translocation of cytolytic molecules, leading to the execution of cell death in
parallel to the caspase-9 signaling cascade.

The comet assay is used to measure DNA damage induced by chemical and physical
agents. High concentrations of test agents may cause cytotoxicity or cell death, 
which may give rise to false positive results in the comet assay. Systematic
studies on genotoxins and cytotoxins (i.e. non-genotoxic poisons) have attempted 
to establish a threshold of cytotoxicity or cell death by which DNA damage
results measured by the comet assay could be regarded as a false positive result.
Thresholds of cytotoxicity/cell death range from 20% to 50% in various
publications. Curiously, a survey of the latest literature on comet assay results
from cell culture studies suggests that one-third of publications did not assess 
cytotoxicity or cell death. We recommend that it should be mandatory to include
results from at least one type of assay on cytotoxicity, cell death or cell
proliferation in publications on comet assay results. A combination of
cytotoxicity (or cell death) and proliferation (or colony forming efficiency
assay) is preferable in actively proliferating cells because it covers more
mechanisms of action. Applying a general threshold of cytotoxicity/cell death to 
all types of agents may not be applicable; however, 25% compared to the
concurrent negative control seems to be a good starting value to avoid false
positive comet assay results. Further research is needed to establish a threshold
value to distinguish between true and potentially false positive genotoxic
effects detected by the comet assay.

Programmed cell death (PCD) is a common cell fate in metazoan development. PCD
effectors are extensively studied, but how they are temporally regulated is less 
understood. Here, we report a mechanism controlling tail-spike cell death onset
during Caenorhabditis elegans development. We show that the zinc-finger
transcription factor BLMP-1, which controls larval development timing, also
regulates embryonic tail-spike cell death initiation. BLMP-1 functions upstream
of CED-9 and in parallel to DRE-1, another CED-9 and tail-spike cell death
regulator. BLMP-1 expression is detected in the tail-spike cell shortly after the
cell is born, and blmp-1 mutations promote ced-9-dependent tail-spike cell
survival. BLMP-1 binds ced-9 gene regulatory sequences, and inhibits ced-9
transcription just before cell-death onset. BLMP-1 and DRE-1 function together to
regulate developmental timing, and their mammalian homologs regulate B-lymphocyte
fate. Our results, therefore, identify roles for developmental timing genes in
cell-death initiation, and suggest conservation of these functions.

Exposure of cells to high voltage electric pulses increases transiently membrane 
permeability through membrane electroporation. Electroporation can be reversible 
and is used in gene transfer and enhanced drug delivery but can also lead to cell
death. Electroporation resulting in cell death (termed as irreversible
electroporation) has been successfully used as a new non-thermal ablation method 
of soft tissue such as tumours or arrhythmogenic heart tissue. Even though the
mechanisms of cell death can influence the outcome of electroporation-based
treatments due to use of different electric pulse parameters and conditions,
these are not elucidated yet. We review the mechanisms of cell death after
electroporation reported in literature, cell injuries that may lead to cell death
after electroporation and membrane repair mechanisms involved. The knowledge of
membrane repair and cell death mechanisms after cell exposure to electric pulses,
targets of electric field in cells need to be identified to optimize existing and
develop of new electroporation-based techniques used in medicine, biotechnology, 
and food technology.

Lung transplantation is the most effective therapy for patients with end-stage
lung disease. However, concern of donor lung damage and ischemia-reperfusion
induced lung injury limits the use of "marginal" donor lungs. Recent
transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that the enrichment of gene-clusters
related to cell death and inflammation are the most profound signals during
ischemia-reperfusion in human lung transplants. Herein, we focus on the
relationship between inflammation and programmed cell death, especially
necroptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition-initiated regulated necrosis, 
pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagic cell death. Cell death-related molecules 
have been tested as potential biomarkers for donor lung assessment. Inhibitors
for various types of cell death have been explored as therapeutics for ischemia
reperfusion injury in lung transplantation. A deeper understanding of these
mechanisms may help to improve donor management, organ preservation, prevention
and treatment of primary graft dysfunction during and post transplantation.
Moreover, evaluation and treatment of cell death and inflammation during ex vivo 
lung perfusion may be a game changer in donor organ management, assessment,
repair, and reconditioning.

Extracellular ATP is a purinergic signal with important functions in regulating
plant growth and stress-adaptive responses, including programmed cell death.
While signalling events proximate to receptor activation at the plasma membrane
have been characterised, downstream protein targets and the mechanism of cell
death activation/regulation are unknown. We designed a proteomic screen to
identify ATP-responsive proteins in Arabidopsis cell cultures exposed to
mycotoxin stress via fumonisin B1 (FB1) application. Arabidopsis RIBONUCLEASE 1
(RNS1) was identified by the screen, and transgenic plants overexpressing native 
RNS1 showed greater susceptibility to FB1, while a gene knockout rns1 mutant and 
antisense RNS1 transgenic plants were resistant to FB1-induced cell death. Native
RNS1 complemented rns1 mutants and restored the cell death response to FB1, while
a catalytically inactive version of the ribonuclease could not. The FB1
resistance of salicylic acid (SA)-depleted nahG-expressing plants was abolished
by transformation with native RNS1, but not the catalytically dead version. The
mechanism of FB1-induced cell death is activation of RNS1-dependent RNA cleavage,
which is blocked by ATP via RNS1 suppression, or enhanced by SA through induction
of RNS1 expression. Our study reveals RNS1 as a previously unknown convergence
point of ATP and SA signalling in the regulation of stress-induced cell death.

BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are evolutionarily conserved
morphogens that are reactivated in lung carcinomas. In lung cancer cells, BMP
signaling suppresses AMP activated kinase (AMPK) by inhibiting LKB1. AMPK is
activated by mitochondrial stress that inhibits ATP production, which is enhanced
100-fold when phosphorylated by LKB1. Activated AMPK can promote survival of
cancer cells but its "hyperactivation" induces cell death. The studies here
reveal novel cell death mechanisms induced by BMP inhibitors, together with
agents targeting the mitochondria, which involves the "hyperactivation" of AMPK.
METHODS: This study examines the synergistic effects of two BMP inhibitors
together with mitochondrial targeting agents phenformin and Ym155, on cell death 
of lung cancer cells expressing LKB1 (H1299), LKB1 null (A549), and A549 cells
transfected with LKB1 (A549-LKB1). Cell death mechanisms evaluated were the
activation of caspases and the nuclear localization of apoptosis inducing factor 
(AIF). A769662 was used to allosterically activate AMPK. Knockdown of BMPR2 and
LKB1 using siRNA was used to examine their effects on nuclear localization of
AMPK. Validation studies were performed on five passage zero primary NSCLC.
RESULTS: Both BMP inhibitors synergistically suppressed growth when combined with
Ym155 or phenformin in cells expressing LKB1. The combination of BMP inhibitors
with mitochondrial targeting agents enhanced the activation of AMPK in lung
cancer cells expressing LKB1. Allosteric activation of AMPK with A769662 induced 
cell death in both H1299 and A549 cells. Cell death induced by the combination of
BMP inhibitors and mitochondrial-targeting agents did not activate caspases. The 
combination of drugs induced nuclear localization of AIF in cells expressing
LKB1, which was attenuated by knockdown of LKB1. Knockdown of BMPR2 together with
Ym155 increased nuclear localization of AIF. Combination therapy also enhanced
cell death and AIF nuclear localization in primary NSCLC.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that inhibition of BMP signaling together 
with mitochondrial targeting agents induce AIF caspase-independent cell death,
which involves the "hyperactivation" of AMPK. AIF caspase-independent cell death 
is an evolutionarily conserved cell death pathway that is infrequently studied in
cancer. These studies provide novel insight into mechanisms inducing AIF
caspase-independent cell death in cancer cells using BMP inhibitors. Video

Cell death is an essential process that plays a vital role in restoring and
maintaining skin homeostasis. It supports recovery from acute injury and
infection and regulates barrier function and immunity. Cell death can also
provoke inflammatory responses. Loss of cell membrane integrity with lytic forms 
of cell death can incite inflammation due to the uncontrolled release of cell
contents. Excessive or poorly regulated cell death is increasingly recognised as 
contributing to cutaneous inflammation. Therefore, drugs that inhibit cell death 
could be used therapeutically to treat certain inflammatory skin diseases.
Programmes to develop such inhibitors are already underway. In this review, we
outline the mechanisms of skin-associated cell death programmes; apoptosis,
necroptosis, pyroptosis, NETosis, and the epidermal terminal differentiation
programme, cornification. We discuss the evidence for their role in skin
inflammation and disease and discuss therapeutic opportunities for targeting the 
cell death machinery.

Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CLs), and more specifically Tc and NK cells, are the main 
executors of cell death in the immune system, playing a key role during both
immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. These cells induce regulated cell death
(RCD) by different mechanisms, being granular exocytosis and expression of death 
ligands the most prominent and best characterized ones. Apoptosis, a
traditionally considered low-inflammatory type of cell death, has been accepted
for years as the paradigm of RCD induced by CLs. However, several recent studies 
have demonstrated that NK cells and Tc cells can also induce more inflammatory
forms of cell death, namely, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. Activation
of these highly inflammatory types of cell death appears to critically contribute
to the activation of a successful antitumour immune response. Additionally, the
role of specific cell death pathways in immunogenic cell death is still under
intense debate, especially considering the interconnections with other
inflammatory forms of cell death. These evidences, together with the advent of
new cancer immunotherapies, highlight the necessity to deepen our understanding
of the link between the cell death triggered by CLs and inflammation. This
knowledge will be instrumental to maximize the antitumour potential of
immunotherapies, minimizing deleterious effects associated with these treatments.
In this review, we will briefly summarize the main features of apoptosis,
necroptosis, pyroptosis and ferroptosis, to subsequently discuss the most recent 
evidences about the role of these RCD pathways during the elimination of cancer
cells mediated by CLs and its modulation to increase the efficacy of cancer
immunotherapy.

Ferroptosis is primarily triggered by a failure of the glutathione
(GSH)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) reductive system and associated
overwhelming lipid peroxidation, in which enzymes regulating polyunsaturated
fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism, and in particular acyl-CoA synthetase long chain
family member 4 (ACSL4), are central. Here, we found that exogenous oxygen
radicals generated by photodynamic therapy (PDT) can directly peroxidize PUFAs
and initiate lipid autoxidation, coinciding with cellular GSH depletion.
Different from canonical ferroptosis induced by RSL3 or erastin, PDT-initiated
lipid peroxidation and ferroptotis-like cell death is independent of lipoxygenase
(ALOXs) and ACSL4. Especially, this form of cell death modality can be triggered 
in malignant cells insensitive to or acquired resistance to canonical ferroptosis
inducers. We also observed a distinct iron metabolism pathway in this
PDT-triggered cell death modality, in which cytosolic labile iron is decreased
probably due to its relocation to mitochondria. Inhibition of the mitochondrial
Ca2+ and Fe2+ uniporter (MCU) effectively prevented PDT-triggered lipid
peroxidation and subsequent cell death. Therefore, we tentatively term this
distinct ferroptosis-like cell death as liperoptosis. Moreover, using the
clinically approved photosensitizer Verteporfin, PDT inhibited tumor growth
through inducing prevailing ferroptosis-like cell death in a mouse xenograft
model. With its site-specific advantages, these findings highlight the value of
using PDT to trigger lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis-like cell death in vivo, 
and will benefit exploring the exact molecular mechanism of immunological effects
of PDT in cancer treatment.

Plant and animal intracellular nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)
receptors play important roles in sensing pathogens and activating defense
signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of host
defense signaling by NLR proteins remain largely unknown. Many studies have
determined that the coil-coil (CC) or Toll and interleukin-1 receptor/resistance 
protein (TIR) domain of NLR proteins and their dimerization/oligomerization are
critical for activating downstream defense signaling. In this study, we
demonstrated that, in tomato, the nucleotide-binding (NB) domain Sw-5b NLR alone 
can activate downstream defense signaling, leading to elicitor-independent cell
death. Sw-5b NB domains can self-associate, and this self-association is crucial 
for activating cell death signaling. The self-association was strongly
compromised after the introduction of a K568R mutation into the P-loop of the NB 
domain. Consequently, the NBK568R mutant induced cell death very weakly. The
NBCΔ20 mutant lacking the C-terminal 20 amino acids can self-associate but cannot
activate cell death signaling. The NBCΔ20 mutant also interfered with wild-type
NB domain self-association, leading to compromised cell death induction. By
contrast, the NBK568R mutant did not interfere with wild-type NB domain
self-association and its ability to induce cell death. Structural modeling of
Sw-5b suggests that NB domains associate with one another and likely participate 
in oligomerization. As Sw-5b-triggered cell death is dependent on helper NLR
proteins, we propose that the Sw-5b NB domain acts as a nucleation point for the 
assembly of an oligomeric resistosome, probably by recruiting downstream helper
partners, to trigger defense signaling.

All living organisms are destined to die. Cells, the core of those living
creatures, move toward the irresistible direction of death. The question of how
to die is critical and is very interesting. There are various types of death in
life, including natural death, accidental death, questionable death, suicide, and
homicide. The mechanisms and molecules involved in cell death also differ
depending on the type of death. The dysenteric amoeba, E. histolytica, designated
by the German zoologist Fritz Schaudinn in 1903, has the meaning of tissue lysis;
i.e., tissue destroying, in its name. It was initially thought that the amoebae
lyse tissue very quickly leading to cell death called necrosis. However, advances
in measuring cell death have allowed us to more clearly investigate the various
forms of cell death induced by amoeba. Increasing evidence has shown that E.
histolytica can cause host cell death through induction of various intracellular 
signaling pathways. Understanding of the mechanisms and signaling molecules
involved in host cell death induced by amoeba can provide new insights on the
tissue pathology and parasitism in human amoebiasis. In this review, we
emphasized on the signaling role of NADPH oxidases in reactive oxygen species
(ROS)-dependent cell death by pathogenic E. histolytica.

Upon influenza A virus (IAV) infection, the IAV progeny ribonucleoprotein
complex, with a defective viral genome, is sensed by DNA-dependent activator of
interferon-regulatory factor (DAI). DAI initiates the recruitment of an array of 
proteins to form a multiprotein platform (PANoptosome), which triggers apoptosis,
necroptosis, and pyroptosis during IAV infection. However, the mechanisms
mediating the assembly of the PANoptosome are unclear. Here, we identified a
scaffold protein, sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9), which could interact with
DAI to promote cell death during IAV infection. We further demonstrated that the 
cell death enhanced by SPAG9 was achieved through the DAI/SPAG9/c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) axis, which could promote IAV-induced DAI-mediated cell death,
including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. Our data further showed that
the DAI/SPAG9/JNK signaling pathway enhanced the interactions among
receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, and DAI, thereby
promoting IAV-induced PANoptosome formation. Overall, our study for the first
time revealed a feed-forward circuit signaling pathway that enhanced IAV-induced 
DAI-mediated cell death, provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of cell 
death, and established therapeutic targets to address infectious and inflammatory
diseases. IMPORTANCE Upon influenza A virus (IAV) infection, DAI is activated,
recruits downstream proteins to assemble a multiprotein platform (PANoptosome),
and then triggers cell death. Until now, the protein composition and assembly
mechanism of the PANoptosome during IAV infection had not been elucidated. Using 
proximity labeling and mass spectrometry technology, we identified SPAG9 as a
novel component of the PANoptosome and confirmed that SPAG9 promotes IAV-induced 
cell death by enhancing the interaction among RIPK1, RIPK3, and DAI. Our study
will broaden the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of cell death.

OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune-associated β-cell
loss, insulin insufficiency, and hyperglycemia. Although TNFα signaling is
associated with β-cell loss and hyperglycemia in non-obese diabetic mice and
human T1D, the molecular mechanisms of β-cell TNF receptor signaling have not
been fully characterized. Based on work in other cell types, we hypothesized that
receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and receptor interacting protein
kinase 3 (RIPK3) regulate TNFα-induced β-cell death in concert with caspase
activity.
METHODS: We evaluated TNFα-induced cell death, caspase activity, and TNF receptor
pathway molecule expression in immortalized NIT-1 and INS-1 β-cell lines and
primary mouse islet cells in vitro. Our studies utilized genetic and small
molecule approaches to alter RIPK1 and RIPK3 expression and caspase activity to
interrogate mechanisms of TNFα-induced β-cell death. We used the β-cell toxin
streptozotocin (STZ) to determine the susceptibility of Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3-/-
mice to hyperglycemia in vivo.
RESULTS: Expression of TNF receptor signaling molecules including RIPK1 and RIPK3
was identified in NIT-1 and INS-1 β cells and isolated mouse islets at the mRNA
and protein levels. TNFα treatment increased NIT-1 and INS-1 cell death and
caspase activity after 24-48 h, and BV6, a small molecule inhibitor of inhibitor 
of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) amplified this TNFα-induced cell death. RIPK1
deficient NIT-1 cells were protected from TNFα- and BV6-induced cell death and
caspase activation. Interestingly, small molecule inhibition of caspases with
zVAD-fmk (zVAD) did not prevent TNFα-induced cell death in either NIT-1 or INS-1 
cells. This caspase-independent cell death was increased by BV6 treatment and
decreased in RIPK1 deficient NIT-1 cells. RIPK3 deficient NIT-1 cells and RIPK3
kinase inhibitor treated INS-1 cells were protected from TNFα+zVAD-induced cell
death, whereas RIPK3 overexpression increased INS-1 cell death and promoted RIPK3
and MLKL interaction under TNFα+zVAD treatment. In mouse islet cells, BV6 or zVAD
treatment promoted TNFα-induced cell death, and TNFα+zVAD-induced cell death was 
blocked by RIPK3 inhibition and in Ripk3-/- islet cells in vitro. Ripk3-/- mice
were also protected from STZ-induced hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance
in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: RIPK1 and RIPK3 regulate TNFα-induced β-cell death in concert with
caspase activity in immortalized and primary islet β cells. TNF receptor
signaling molecules such as RIPK1 and RIPK3 may represent novel therapeutic
targets to promote β-cell survival and glucose homeostasis in T1D.

The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against cellular
perturbations. Innate immune activation elicits inflammatory programmed cell
death in response to microbial infections or alterations in cellular homeostasis.
Among the most well-characterized programmed cell death pathways are pyroptosis, 
apoptosis, and necroptosis. While these pathways have historically been defined
as segregated and independent processes, mounting evidence shows significant
crosstalk among them. These molecular interactions have been described as
'crosstalk', 'plasticity', 'redundancies', 'molecular switches', and more. Here, 
we discuss the key components of cell death pathways and note several examples of
crosstalk. We then explain how the diverse descriptions of crosstalk throughout
the literature can be interpreted through the lens of an integrated inflammatory 
cell death concept, PANoptosis. The totality of biological effects in PANoptosis 
cannot be individually accounted for by pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis
alone. We also discuss PANoptosomes, which are multifaceted macromolecular
complexes that regulate PANoptosis. We consider the evidence for PANoptosis,
which has been mechanistically characterized during influenza A virus, herpes
simplex virus 1, Francisella novicida, and Yersinia infections, as well as in
response to altered cellular homeostasis, in inflammatory diseases, and in
cancers. We further discuss the role of IRF1 as an upstream regulator of
PANoptosis and conclude by reexamining historical studies which lend credence to 
the PANoptosis concept. Cell death has been shown to play a critical role in
infections, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and more;
therefore, having a holistic understanding of cell death is important for
identifying new therapeutic strategies.

Crosstalk between trophoblast and monocytes is essential for gestational success,
and it can be compromised in congenital toxoplasmosis. Cell death is one of the
mechanisms involved in the maintenance of pregnancy, and this study aimed to
evaluate the role of trophoblast in the modulation of monocyte cell death in the 
presence or absence of Toxoplasma gondii infection. THP-1 cells were stimulated
with supernatants of BeWo cells and then infected or not with T. gondii. The
supernatants were collected and analyzed for the secretion of human Fas ligand,
and cells were used to determine cell death and apoptosis, cell death receptor,
and intracellular proteins expression. Cell death and apoptosis index were higher
in uninfected THP-1 cells stimulated with supernatants of BeWo cells; however,
apoptosis index was reduced by T. gondii infection. Macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, secreted by BeWo
cells, altered the cell death and apoptosis rates in THP-1 cells. In infected
THP-1 cells, the expression of Fas/CD95 and secretion of FasL was significantly
higher; however, caspase 3 and phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase (ERK1/2) were downregulated. Results suggest that soluble factors secreted
by BeWo cells induce cell death and apoptosis in THP-1 cells, and Fas/CD95 can be
involved in this process. On the other hand, T. gondii interferes in the
mechanism of cell death and inhibits THP-1 cell apoptosis, which can be
associated with active caspase 3 and phosphorylated ERK1/2. In conclusion, our
results showed that human BeWo trophoblast cells and T. gondii infection modulate
cell death in human THP-1 monocyte cells.

BACKGROUND: Melatonin is a hormone that is primarily produced in the pineal gland
and is involved in wide range of biological functions. However, the impact of
melatonin on chemotherapy-induced cell death remains to be elucidated in oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. The objective of this study was to clarify 
the role of melatonin in cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in CD44high OSCC cells.
METHODS: CD44high OSCC cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated hydrogel. A
lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay was performed to evaluate
cisplatin-induced cell death. The effect of melatonin on cisplatin-induced cell
death and Derlin-1 (DERL1) endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein expression was 
investigated.
RESULTS: CD44high OSCC cells exhibited mesenchymal-like features when cultured on
fibronectin-coated hydrogel. Mesenchymal-like CD44high OSCC cells demonstrated
strong resistance to cisplatin-induced cell death compared with epithelial-like
CD44high OSCC cells. DERL1 mRNA and DERL1 protein expression levels were
significantly higher in mesenchymal-like CD44high cells compared with
epithelial-like CD44high cells. Cisplatin-induced cell death was significantly
enhanced after DERL1 siRNA knockdown, suggesting that DERL1 is involved in
resistance to cisplatin-induced cell death. Melatonin significantly inhibited
DERL1 expression and enhanced cisplatin-induced cell death in mesenchymal-like
CD44high cells. miR-181c-5p expression was significantly upregulated in the
presence of melatonin. Furthermore, melatonin-inhibited DERL1 expression was
significantly recovered by miR-181c-5p inhibitor. In addition, melatoninenhanced 
cisplatin-induced cell death was attenuated by miR-181c-5p inhibitor. These
results suggest that melatonin-induced miR-181c-5p enhances cisplatin-induced
cell death through inhibition of DERL1 in mesenchymal-like CD44high cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin plays a vital role in promoting cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity in mesenchymal-like CD44high OSCC cells.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are networks of chromatin and microbicidal 
proteins released by neutrophils in response to infection and tissue damage.
Although classically viewed as a discrete biochemical and cellular process in
neutrophils, the effector pathways integrating diverse upstream activating
signals to control the formation of NETs (NETosis) are poorly defined. Cell death
is one such common unifying endpoint of neutrophils, with several bona fide
non-apoptotic cell death agonists now described to initiate NETosis. Integrating 
these new genetic findings into our existing knowledge of NETosis will likely
reveal varied cellular and biochemical processes controlling NET release and
specific anti-microbial and inflammatory effector functions of NETs triggered by 
specific non-apoptotic cell death. To facilitate investigation of regulated cell 
death pathways in NETosis, we offer a detailed protocol for neutrophil
purification from mouse bone marrow and human blood, analysis of NETs by flow
cytometry, and validation by immunogold electron microscopy. Future studies may
better define cell death-specific forms of NETosis and their influence on
inflammation and autoimmunity.

Sepsis is an abnormal immune response to infection characterized by an
overwhelming systemic inflammation and cell death. Non-apoptotic cell death
pertaining to pyroptosis, necroptosis and autophagy contribute to sepsis
pathogenesis apart from classical apoptotic cell death. The objective of the
current study is to investigate the presence of molecular markers of relevance to
apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death in control healthy subjects and septic
patient survivors. Sepsis survivors (N = 24) and healthy human volunteers (N =
16) [40 total subjects] were recruited into the study. Clinical intervention
included antibiotic treatment regimen administered to patients upon clinical
diagnosis of sepsis followed by blood draw 18-24 hr post-antibiotic dose. Serum
samples analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by flow cytometry analysis for identification of 
cell death markers. Cell death markers analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry
included caspase-1, caspase-3, MLKL, RIPK3, p62 and LC3B. Serum and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of septic survivors and healthy controls analyzed
for the presence of distinct cell death markers. Markers of relevance to
apoptosis (caspase-3), pyroptosis (caspase-1), necroptosis (MLKL) and autophagy
(p62 and LC3B) were compared between septic survivors and healthy controls. ELISA
analysis suggested significant alterations in the serum levels of non-apoptotic
cell death markers, caspase-1 and p62/SQSTM1, in septic survivors compared to
healthy controls (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the serum
levels of caspase-3 and MLKL between septic survivors and healthy control
subjects (p> 0.05). Intracellular caspase-1 levels did not show any significant
alterations between septic survivors and healthy control subjects (p > 0.05).
Flow cytometry analysis suggested significant increase in the intracellular
expression of caspase-3, MLKL and its associated kinase RIPK3, and p62/SQSTM1 (p 
< 0.05) in sepsis patient survivors when compared to healthy human subjects. The 
current observational study identified significantly elevated levels of
non-apoptotic cell death markers in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls.
Noteworthy observation is the significant modulation of non-apoptotic cell death 
markers in serum samples derived from septic survivors post-antibiotic
administration compared to healthy control subjects. Preliminary results serve as
a basis for further mechanistic investigations to elucidate the role of distinct 
cell death markers in the prediction of clinical outcomes in sepsis.

Significance: Persistent oxidative stress is a common feature of cancer cells,
giving a specific weapon to selectively eliminate them. Ascorbate in
pharmacological concentration can contribute to the suspended formation of
hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction; thus, it can be an important element of
the oxidative stress therapy against cancer cells. Recent Advances: The main
components of ascorbate-induced cell death are DNA double-strand breaks via the
production of hydroxyl radical and ATP depletion due to the activation of poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1. Presumably, DNA damage can be the primary contributor 
to the anticancer activity of pharmacological ascorbate, as opposed to the
rupture of bioenergetics. The caspase independency of high-dose ascorbate-induced
cell death proposed the possible involvement of several types of cell death, such
as ferroptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy. Critical Issues: Ascorbate can target
at least two key molecular features of cancer cells as a part of the anticancer
therapy: the intrinsic or acquired resistance to cell death and the dysregulated 
metabolism of cancer cells. It seems probable that different concentrations of
ascorbate alter the nature of induced cell death. Autophagy and necroptosis may
play a role at intermediate concentrations, but caspase-independent apoptosis may
dominate at higher concentrations. However, ascorbate behaves as an effective
inhibitor of ferroptosis that may have crucial importance in its possible
clinical application. Future Directions: The elucidation of the details and the
links between high-dose ascorbate-induced cancer selective cell death mechanisms 
may give us a tool to form and apply synergistic cancer therapies. Antioxid.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), often induced by sports, car accidents, falls, or
other daily occurrences, is a primary non-genetically related risk factor for the
development of subsequent neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, cell death, and
neurobehavioral dysfunction following TBI remain unclear. Here, we found that
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was hyperactivated following TBI and its
inhibition reduced TBI-induced brain injury. Macrophage migration inhibitory
factor (MIF), a newly identified nuclease involved in PARP-1-dependent cell
death, was translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus in cortical neurons
following TBI and promoted neuronal cell death in vivo. Genetic deletion of MIF
protected neurons from TBI-induced dendritic spine loss, morphological complexity
degeneration, and subsequent neuronal cell death in mice. Moreover, MIF knockout 
reduced the brain injury volume and improved long-term animal behavioral
rehabilitation. These neuroprotective effects in MIF knockout mice were reversed 
by the expression of wild-type MIF but not nuclease-deficient MIF mutant. In
contrast, genetic deletion of MIF did not alter TBI-induced neuroinflammation.
These findings reveal that MIF mediates TBI-induced neurodegeneration, neuronal
cell death and neurobehavioral dysfunction through its nuclease activity, but not
its pro-inflammatory role. Targeting MIF's nuclease activity may offer a novel
strategy to protect neurons from TBI.

Emerging evidence suggests that ubiquitin mediated post translational
modification is a critical regulatory process involved in diverse cellular
pathways including cell death. During ubiquitination, E3 ligases recognize target
proteins and determine the topology of ubiquitin chains. Recruitment of E3
ligases to targets proteins under stress conditions including oxidative stress
and their implication in cell death have not been systemically explored. In the
present study, we characterized the role of TRIM32 as an E3 ligase in regulation 
of oxidative stress induced cell death. TRIM32 is ubiquitously expressed in cell 
lines of different origin and form cytoplasmic speckle like structures that
transiently interact with mitochondria under oxidative stress conditions. The
ectopic expression of TRIM32 sensitizes cell death induced by oxidative stress
whereas TRIM32 knockdown shows a protective effect. The turnover of TRIM32 is
enhanced during oxidative stress and its expression induces ROS generation, loss 
of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and decrease in complex-I activity. The 
pro-apoptotic effect was rescued by pan-caspase inhibitor or antioxidant
treatment. E3 ligase activity of TRIM32 is essential for oxidative stress induced
apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, TRIM32 decreases X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis (XIAP) level and overexpression of XIAP rescued cells from TRIM32
mediated oxidative stress and cell death. Overall, the results of this study
provide the first evidence supporting the role of TRIM32 in regulating oxidative 
stress induced cell death, which has implications in numerous pathological
conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration.

COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that occurred in 2019. The
virus-host-specific interactions, molecular targets on host cell deaths, and the 
involved signaling are crucial issues, which become potential targets for
treatment. Spike protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cathepsin
L-cysteine peptidase, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), nonstructural
protein 1 (Nsp1), open reading frame 7a (ORF7a), viral main protease (3C-like
protease (3CLpro) or Mpro), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Nsp12),
non-structural protein 13 (Nsp13) helicase, and papain-like proteinase (PLpro)
are molecules associated with SARS-CoV infection and propagation. SARS-CoV-2 can 
induce host cell death via five kinds of regulated cell death, i.e., apoptosis,
necroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, and PANoptosis. The mechanisms of these cell 
deaths are well established and can be disrupted by synthetic small molecules or 
natural products. There are a variety of compounds proven to play roles in the
cell death inhibition, such as pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) for apoptosis,
necrostatin-1 for necroptosis, MCC950, a potent and specific inhibitor of the
NLRP3 inflammasome in pyroptosis, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, which can
mitigate the corresponding cell death pathways. However, NF-κB signaling is
another critical anti-apoptotic or survival route mediated by SARS-CoV-2. Such
signaling promotes viral survival, proliferation, and inflammation by inducing
the expression of apoptosis inhibitors such as Bcl-2 and XIAP, as well as
cytokines, e.g., TNF. As a result, tiny natural compounds functioning as
proteasome inhibitors such as celastrol and curcumin can be used to modify NF-κB 
signaling, providing a responsible method for treating SARS-CoV-2-infected
patients. The natural constituents that aid in inhibiting viral infection,
progression, and amplification of coronaviruses are also emphasized, which are in
the groups of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, diarylheptanoids, and
anthraquinones. Natural constituents derived from medicinal herbs have
anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, as well as inhibitory effects, on the
viral life cycle, including viral entry, replication, assembly, and release of
COVID-19 virions. The phytochemicals contain a high potential for COVID-19
treatment. As a result, SARS-CoV-2-infected cell death processes and signaling
might be of high efficacy for therapeutic targeting effects and yielding
encouraging outcomes.

Cell Death in Escherichia coli: Incomplete Base Excision Repair under Depletion
of DapB and Dxr Proteins.

(Akdeniz) University, Antalya, Turkey.

The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the cell is a
significantly shared aspect of bacterial cell death against different stress
conditions. The main cell death mechanism due to the generation of reactive
oxygen species is then the incomplete base excision repair (BER) in response to
oxidized nucleotides. In their recent article in mBio, C. C. Gruber, V. M. P.
Babu, K. Livingston, H. Joisher, and G. C. Walker (mBio 13[1]:e03756-21, 2022)
report two new stress conditions regarding the depletion of DapB and Dxr, which
indeed cause similar mechanisms for cell death. These two stress conditions
trigger highly distinctive stress response mechanisms within the cell, but the
ultimate cell death mechanism is a result of a shared process. These findings
prove that the disturbance in the homeostasis of cells under a variety of
different stresses initiates cell death mechanisms through the production of ROS,
generation of 8-oxo-dG and the incomplete BER.

The hypersensitive response (HR) is a robust immune response mediated by
nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). However, the early
molecular event that links activated NLRs to cell death is unclear. Here, we
demonstrate that NLRs target plasma membrane H+ -ATPases (PMAs) that generate
electrochemical potential, an essential component of living cells, across the
plasma membrane. CCA 309, an autoactive N-terminal domain of a coiled-coil NLR
(CNL) in pepper, is associated with PMAs. Silencing or overexpression of PMAs
reversibly affects cell death induced by CCA 309 in Nicotiana benthamiana. CCA
309-induced extracellular alkalization causes plasma membrane depolarization,
followed by cell death. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses suggest that CCA 309
inhibits PMA activation by preoccupying the dephosphorylated penultimate
threonine residue of PMA. Moreover, pharmacological experiments using fusicoccin,
an irreversible PMA activator, showed that inhibition of PMAs contributes to
CNL-type (but not Toll interleukin-1 receptor NLR-type) resistance
protein-induced cell death. We suggest PMAs as primary targets of plasma
membrane-associated CNLs leading to HR-associated cell death by disturbing the
electrochemical gradient across the membrane. These results provide new insight
into NLR-mediated cell death in plants, as well as innate immunity in higher
eukaryotes.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism for aging and longevity studies. In 
a clonal population of S. cerevisiae, the timing of cell death in the stationary 
phase is not synchronized, indicating that heterogeneity exists in survival at a 
single-cell level. Heterogeneity also exists in the cell size, and its
correlation with the death rate has been discussed in past studies. However, the 
direct cause of the heterogeneity in survival remains unknown. In this report, we
revisited this question and asked whether the death rate has any correlation with
cell size. Past studies did not exclude a possibility that cells change their
size upon or after death. If such a change exists, the size dependence of cell
death could be misinterpreted. Therefore, we analyzed the correlation between the
death rate and cell size before death by time-lapse imaging. It turned out that
the size dependence of the death rate varied from one strain to another,
suggesting that general principles between cell size and death do not exist.
Instead, cells shrink upon cell death, resulting in the accumulation of small
dead cells. The degree of cell shrinkage was proportional to the cell size, and
the ratio was constant in two strains, which is between 25 and 28%, suggesting
the presence of general principles and mechanisms behind the shrinkage event upon
cell death. Further investigation of the cause and mechanism of the shrinkage
will help us to understand the process of cell death and the origin of the
heterogeneity in survival. IMPORTANCE Cells display various behaviors even though
they originate from a clonal population. Such diversity is also observed in cell 
survival in the stationary phase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, we know
little about the causes of heterogeneity in the timing of cell death at a
single-cell level. To deepen our understanding of the cause of heterogeneity, we 
observed the process of cell death in S. cerevisiae by time-lapse imaging. Our
analysis showed that cells shrank upon cell death, resulting in the accumulation 
of small dead cells, while a general principle in the correlation between cell
size and death was not seen. The degree of cell shrinkage was proportional to
cell size before cell death, and it was constant under all conditions tested,
indicating the presence of general principles behind the shrinkage event. Future 
studies to identify the cause of cell shrinkage must contribute to finding the
origin of the heterogeneity in survival.

Cell death is involved in numerous pathological conditions such as cardiovascular
disorders, ischemic stroke and organ transplant rejection, and plays a critical
role in the treatment of cancer. Cell death imaging can serve as a noninvasive
means to detect the severity of tissue damage, monitor the progression of
diseases, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, which help to provide
prognostic information and guide the formulation of individualized treatment
plans. The high abundance of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which is
predominantly confined to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer membrane in
healthy mammalian cells, becomes exposed on the cell surface in the early stages 
of apoptosis or accessible to the extracellular milieu when the cell suffers from
necrosis, thus representing an attractive target for cell death imaging.
Duramycin is a tetracyclic polypeptide that contains 19 amino acids and can bind 
to PE with excellent affinity and specificity. Additionally, this peptide has
several favorable structural traits including relatively low molecular weight,
stability to enzymatic hydrolysis, and ease of conjugation and labeling. All
these highlight the potential of duramycin as a candidate ligand for developing
PE-specific molecular probes. By far, a couple of duramycin-based molecular
probes such as Tc-99 m-, F-18-, or Ga-68-labeled duramycin have been developed to
target exposed PE for in vivo noninvasive imaging of cell death in different
animal models. In this review article, we describe the state of the art with
respect to in vivo imaging of cell death using duramycin-based molecular probes, 
as validated by immunohistopathology.

Radiation-induced Cell Death and Its Mechanisms.

Medical University, Shanghai, China.

ABSTRACT: With rapid technical advances, ionizing radiation has been put into
wider application in ordinary living, with the worst cytological effect on the
human body being cell death. Moreover, according to the Nomenclature Committee on
Cell Death, the method of radiation-induced cell death, usually classified as
interphase and proliferative death, undergoes more detailed classifications
oriented by its molecular mechanism. Elaborating its mode and molecular mechanism
is crucial for the protection and treatment of radiation injury, as well as the
radiotherapy and recovery of tumors. Varying with the changes of the radiation
dose and the environment, the diverse targets and pathways of ionizing radiation 
result in various cell deaths. This review focuses on classifications of
radiation-induced cell death and its molecular mechanism. We also examine the
main characteristics of ionizing radiation-induced cell death. The modes of
radiation-induced cell death can be classified as apoptosis, necrosis,
autophagy-dependent cell death, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, immunogenic cell death, 
and non-lethal processes. Once the dose is high enough, radiation effects mostly 
appear as destructiveness ("destructiveness" is used to describe a situation in
which cells do not have the opportunity to undergo a routine death process, in
which case high-dose radiation works like a physical attack). This breaks up or
even shatters cells, making it difficult to find responses of the cell itself.
Due to diversities concerning cell phenotypes, phases of cell cycle, radiation
dose, and even cellular subregions, various methods of cell death occur, which
are difficult to identify and classify. Additionally, the existence of common
initial activation and signaling molecules among all kinds of cell deaths, as
well as sophisticated crossways in cellular molecules, makes it more laborious to
distinguish and classify various cell deaths.

24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) are
produced by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase and cholesterol 25-hydroxylase,
respectively. The purpose of the present study was to determine the type of cell 
death induced by these oxysterols in neuronal cells, hepatic cells, and
keratinocytes, and to elucidate the inhibitory effect of vitamin E homologues on 
various types of cell death. In human neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y cells), 24S-OHC and
25-OHC caused a cell death that was independent of caspase activation. We
reported previously that the esterification of 24S-OHC by acyl-CoA:cholesterol
acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and the resulting formation of a lipid droplet
(LD)-like structure are responsible for the 24S-OHC-induced neuronal cell death. 
Here, we found that 25-OHC also induced ACAT1-mediated 25-OHC esterification and 
LD formation in neuronal cells. 25-OHC-induced cell death was inhibited by
α-tocopherol (α-Toc) but not by α-tocotrienol (α-Toc3), as observed for
24S-OHC-induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. In human hepatic cells (HepG2
cells), these oxysterols caused a cell death that was caspase- and
oxysterol-esterification-independent. This cell death was suppressed by both
α-Toc and α-Toc3, suggesting the involvement of free-radical-mediated lipid
peroxidation in the cell death induced by these oxysterols in hepatic cells. In
human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), these oxysterols caused a caspase-dependent
but oxysterol-esterification-independent cell death that was inhibited by α-Toc
but not by α-Toc3. These results suggest that α-Toc and α-Toc3 act as
radical-scavenging antioxidants against oxysterol-induced cell death in the same 
way in hepatic cells, whereas their behavior is different in inhibition of cell
death in neuronal cells and keratinocytes. Collectively, these results
demonstrated that 24S-OHC and 25-OHC induced the same type of cell death in each 
of the cell types examined, and that α-Toc and α-Toc3 exerted different effects, 
depending on the type of cell death.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer death in women worldwide. Recent advances in the field of immuno-oncology 
demonstrate the beneficial immunostimulatory effects of the induction of
immunogenic cell death (ICD). ICD increases tumor infiltration by T cells and is 
associated with improved prognosis in patients affected by triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) with residual disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
antitumoral effect of PKHB1, a thrombospondin-1 peptide mimic, against breast
cancer cells, and the immunogenicity of the cell death induced by PKHB1 in vitro,
ex vivo, and in vivo. Our results showed that PKHB1 induces mitochondrial
alterations, ROS production, intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, as well
calcium-dependent cell death in breast cancer cells, including triple negative
subtypes. PKHB1 has antitumor effect in vivo leading to a reduction of tumor
volume and weight and promotes intratumoral CD8 + T cell infiltration.
Furthermore, in vitro, PKHB1 induces calreticulin (CALR), HSP70, and HSP90
exposure and release of ATP and HMGB1. Additionally, the killed cells obtained
after treatment with PKHB1 (PKHB1-KC) induced dendritic cell maturation, and T
cell antitumor responses, ex vivo. Moreover, PKHB1-KC in vivo were able to induce
an antitumor response against breast cancer cells in a prophylactic application, 
whereas in a therapeutic setting, PKHB1-KC induced tumor regression; both
applications induced a long-term antitumor response. Altogether our data shows
that PKHB1, a thrombospondin-1 peptide mimic, has in vivo antitumor effect and
induce immune system activation through immunogenic cell death induction in
breast cancer cells.

Neurodegenerative diseases are generally characterized clinically by the
selective loss of a distinct subset of neurons and a slow progressive course.
Mounting evidence in vivo indicates that large numbers of neurons pass through a 
long period of injury and dysfunction before the actual death of the cells.
Whether these dying neurons can be rescued and return to a normal, functional
state is uncertain. In the present study, we explored the reversibility of the
neuronal cell death pathway at various stages by monitoring the dynamics of
single cells with high-resolution live-cell spinning disk confocal microscopy in 
an in vitro neuronal cell death model. We exposed differentiated neuronal PC12
cells to ethanol as our cell death model. Results showed that exposure to 5%
ethanol for 24 h induced cell death in &gt;70% of the cells. Ethanol treatment
for 3 h already induced cellular changes and damage such as reactive oxygen
species generation, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ level, phosphatidylserine
exposure, nuclear shrinkage, DNA damage, mitochondrial fragmentation and membrane
potential loss, and retraction of neurites. These phenomena are often associated 
with programmed cell death. Importantly, after removing ethanol and further
culturing these damaged cells in fresh culture medium, cells recovered from all
these cell injuries and generated new neurites. Moreover, results indicated that 
this recovery was not dependent on exogenous NGF and other growth factors in the 
cell culture medium. Overall, our results suggest that targeting dying neurons
can be an effective therapeutic strategy in neurodegenerative diseases.

Cell division and cell death are fundamental processes governing growth and
development across the tree of life. This relationship represents an evolutionary
link between cell cycle and cell death programs that is present in all cells.
Cancer is characterized by aberrant regulation of both, leading to unchecked
proliferation and replicative immortality. Conventional anti-cancer therapeutic
strategies take advantage of the proliferative dependency of cancer yet, in doing
so, are triggering apoptosis, a death pathway to which cancer is inherently
resistant. A thorough understanding of how therapeutics kill cancer cells is
needed to develop novel, more durable treatment strategies. While cancer evolves 
cell-intrinsic resistance to physiological cell death pathways, there are
opportunities for cell cycle agnostic forms of cell death, for example,
necroptosis or ferroptosis. Furthermore, cell cycle independent death programs
are immunogenic, potentially licensing host immunity for additional antitumor
activity. Identifying cell cycle independent vulnerabilities of cancer is
critical for developing alternative strategies that can overcome therapeutic
resistance.

The failure of drug efficacy in clinical trials remains a big issue in cancer
research. This is largely due to the limitations of two-dimensional (2D) cell
cultures, the most used tool in drug screening. Nowadays, three-dimensional (3D) 
cultures, including spheroids, are acknowledged to be a better model of the in
vivo environment, but detailed cell death assays for 3D cultures (including those
for ferroptosis) are scarce. In this work, we show that a new cell death analysis
method, named 3D Cell Death Assay (3DELTA), can efficiently determine different
cell death types including ferroptosis and quantitatively assess cell death in
tumour spheroids. Our method uses Sytox dyes as a cell death marker and Triton
X-100, which efficiently permeabilizes all cells in spheroids, was used to
establish 100% cell death. After optimization of Sytox concentration, Triton
X-100 concentration and timing, we showed that the 3DELTA method was able to
detect signals from all cells without the need to disaggregate spheroids.
Moreover, in this work we demonstrated that 2D experiments cannot be extrapolated
to 3D cultures as 3D cultures are less sensitive to cell death induction. In
conclusion, 3DELTA is a more cost-effective way to identify and measure cell
death type in 3D cultures, including spheroids.

BACKGROUND: ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) plays a pivotal role in histone acetylation
and aerobic glycolysis. In plant, ACL is a heteromeric enzyme composed of ACLA
(45 kD) and ACLB (65 kD). So far, the function of ACL genes in cotton still
remains unknown.
RESULTS: Here, we identified three ACLA homologous sequences and two ACLB
homologous in each genome/sub-genome of cotton species. Silencing ACLB in cotton 
led to cell death at newly-grown leaves and stem apexes. Simultaneously, in
ACLB-silenced plants, transcription factors related to senescence including SGR, 
WRKY23 and Osl57 were observed to be activated. Further investigation showed that
excessive H2O2 was accumulated, salicylic acid-dependent defense response and
pathogenesis-related gene expressions were evidently enhanced in ACLB-silenced
plants, implying that knockdown of ACLB genes leads to hypersensitive
response-like cell death in cotton seedlings. However, as noted, serious cell
death happened in newly-grown leaves and stem apexes in ACLB-silenced plants,
which led to the failure of subsequent fungal pathogenicity assays. To confirm
the role of ACLB gene in regulating plant immune response, the dicotyledonous
model plant Arabidopsis was selected for functional verification of ACLB gene.
Our results indicate the resistance to Verticillium dahliae infection in the
Arabidopsis mutant aclb-2 were enhanced without causing strong cell death.
Ectopic expression of GausACLB-2 in Arabidopsis weakened its resistance to V.
dahliae either in Col-0 or in aclb-2 background, in which the expression level of
ACLB is negatively correlated with the resistance to V. dahliae.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ACLB has a new function in negatively
affecting the induction of plant defense response and cell death in cotton, which
provides theoretical guidance for developing cotton varieties with resistance
against Verticillium wilt.

Largemouth bass virus (LMBV), belonging to the genus Ranavirus, causes high
mortality and heavy economic losses in largemouth bass aquaculture. In the
present study, a novel cell line, designated as MsF, was established from the fin
of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and applied to investigate the
characteristics of cell death induced by LMBV. MsF cells showed susceptibility to
LMBV, evidenced by the occurrence of a cytopathic effect (CPE), increased viral
gene transcription, protein synthesis, and viral titers. In LMBV-infected MsF
cells, two or more virus assembly sites were observed around the nucleus.
Notably, no apoptotic bodies occurred in LMBV-infected MsF cells after nucleus
staining, suggesting that cell death induced by LMBV in host cells was distinct
from apoptosis. Consistently, DNA fragmentation was not detected in LMBV-infected
MsF cells. Furthermore, only caspase-8 and caspase-3 were significantly activated
in LMBV-infected MsF cells, suggesting that caspases were involved in
non-apoptotic cell death induced by LMBV in host cells. In addition, the
disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generation were detected in both LMBV-infected MsF cells and
fathead minnow (FHM) cells. Combined with our previous study, we propose that
cell death induced by LMBV infection was cell type dependent. Although
LMBV-infected MsF cells showed the characteristics of non-apoptotic cell death,
the signal pathways might crosstalk and interconnect between apoptosis and other 
PCD during LMBV infection. Together, our results not only established the in
vitro LMBV infection model for the study of the interaction between LMBV and host
cells but also shed new insights into the mechanisms of ranavirus pathogenesis.

Regulated cell death frequently occurs upon infection by intracellular pathogens,
and extent and regulation is often cell-type-specific. We aimed to identify the
cell death-signaling pathways triggered in macrophages by infection with modified
vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), an attenuated strain of vaccinia virus used in
vaccination. While most target cells seem to be protected by antiapoptotic
proteins encoded in the MVA genome, macrophages die when infected with MVA. We
targeted key signaling components of specific cell death-pathways and pattern
recognition-pathways using genome editing and small molecule inhibitors in an in 
vitro murine macrophage differentiation model. Upon infection with MVA, we
observed activation of mitochondrial and death-receptor-induced
apoptosis-pathways as well as the necroptosis-pathway. Inhibition of individual
pathways had a little protective effect but led to compensatory death through the
other pathways. In the absence of mitochondrial apoptosis, autocrine/paracrine
TNF-mediated apoptosis and, in the absence of caspase-activity, necroptosis
occurred. TNF-induction depended on the signaling molecule STING, and MAVS and
ZBP1 contributed to MVA-induced apoptosis. The mode of cell death had a
substantial impact on the cytokine response of infected cells, indicating that
the immunogenicity of a virus may depend not only on its PAMPs but also on its
ability to modulate individual modalities of cell death. These findings provide
insights into the diversity of cell death-pathways that an infection can trigger 
in professional immune cells and advance our understanding of the intracellular
mechanisms that govern the immune response to a virus.

Being sessile, plants must deploy highly exquisite systems to respond to various 
internal and external signals for modulating growth and development throughout
their lifespan. Many studies on Arabidopsis have shown that leucine-rich
repeat-containing receptor-like kinases, including BRI1-associated receptor
kinase 1 (BAK1) and receptor-like protein kinase 1 (RPK1), are suitable for such 
pleiotropic demands of plants. Previously, BAK1 and RPK1 were independently
proven to be involved in the regulation of premature cell death. BAK1 inhibits
spontaneous cell death and promotes defense-induced cell death. Meanwhile, RPK1
mediates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through complexation with CaM4 
and RbohF in an age-dependent manner. In the present study, RPK1-induced cell
death and growth retardation were abolished both with respect to the phenotype
and ROS production in bak1 mutants. Moreover, BAK1 interacts with RPK1 and
mediates its unidirectional phosphorylation in plants. Further, BAK1-mediated
RPK1 phosphorylation is indispensable for RPK1-CaM4 interaction, which is vital
for ROS production, resulting in cell death. The presence of BAK1 enhanced the
expression of cell death- and senescence-related genes, such as ORE1, PR1, SAG12,
and SIRK in RPK1-mediated signaling cascades. Overall, in Arabidopsis, in
addition to independent cell death regulation by BAK1 and RPK1, multiple-layers
control cell death and premature senescence via the coordinated action of BAK1
and RPK1.

Mibefradil and NNC-55-0396, tetralol derivatives with a proven -ability to block 
T-type calcium channels in excitable cells, reduce cancer cell viability in
vitro, causing cell death. Furthermore, they reduce tumor growth in preclinical
models of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a brain tumor of poor prognosis. Here we
found that GBM cells treated with cytotoxic concentrations of NNC-55-0396
paradoxically increased cytosolic calcium levels through the activation of
inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ER stress. We used pharmacological
inhibitors and gene silencing to dissect the cell death pathway stimulated by
NNC-55-0396 in GBM cell lines and biopsy-derived cultures. Calcium chelation or
IP3R inhibition prevented NNC-55-0396-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating that ER
calcium efflux is the cause of cell death. Upstream of calcium mobilization,
NNC-55-0396 activated the IRE1α arm of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
resulting in the nuclear translocation of pro-apoptotic CHOP. Consistent with
these findings, silencing IRE1α or JNK1 rescued the cell death elicited by
NNC-55-0396. Therefore, we demonstrate that activation of IRE1α and calcium
signaling accounts for the cytotoxicity of NNC-55-0396 in GBM cells. The
delineation of the signaling pathway that mediates the abrupt cell death
triggered by this compound can help the development of new therapies for GBM.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a global
health issue. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is highly variable, ranging
from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe. However, the mechanisms for the
high mortality induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are still not well understood.
Recent studies have indicated that the cytokine storm might play an essential
role in the disease progression in patients with COVID-19, which is characterized
by the uncontrolled release of cytokines and chemokines leading to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and even death. Cell
death, especially, inflammatory cell death, might be the initiation of a cytokine
storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review summarizes the forms of cell
death caused by SARS-CoV-2 in vivo or in vitro and elaborates on the dedication
of apoptosis, necroptosis, NETosis, pyroptosis of syncytia, and even SARS-CoV-2 E
proteins forming channel induced cell death, providing insights into targets on
the cell death pathway for the treatment of COVID-19.

The discovery of alternative signaling pathways that regulate cell death has
revealed multiple strategies for promoting cell death with diverse consequences
at the tissue and organism level. Despite the divergence in the molecular
components involved, membrane permeabilization is a common theme in the execution
of regulated cell death. In apoptosis, the permeabilization of the outer
mitochondrial membrane by BAX and BAK releases apoptotic factors that initiate
the caspase cascade and is considered the point of no return in cell death
commitment. Pyroptosis and necroptosis also require the perforation of the plasma
membrane at the execution step, which involves Gasdermins in pyroptosis, and MLKL
in the case of necroptosis. Although BAX/BAK, Gasdermins and MLKL share certain
molecular features like oligomerization, they form pores in different cellular
membranes via distinct mechanisms. Here, we compare and contrast how BAX/BAK,
Gasdermins, and MLKL alter membrane permeability from a structural and
biophysical perspective and discuss the general principles of membrane
permeabilization in the execution of regulated cell death.

Ischemic stroke is one of the significant causes of morbidity and mortality,
affecting millions of people across the globe. Cell injury in the infarct region 
is an inevitable consequence of focal cerebral ischemia. Subsequent reperfusion
exacerbates the harmful effect and increases the infarct volume. These cellular
injuries follow either a regulated pathway involving tightly structured signaling
cascades and molecularly defined effector mechanisms or a non-regulated pathway, 
also known as accidental cell death, where the process is biologically
uncontrolled. Classical cell death pathways are long established and well
reported in several articles that majorly define apoptotic cell death. A recent
focus on cell death study also considers investigation on non-classical pathways 
that are tightly regulated, may or may not involve caspases, but non-apoptotic.
Pathological cell death is a cardinal feature of different neurodegenerative
diseases. Although ischemia cannot be classified as a neurodegenerative disease, 
it is a cerebrovascular event where the infarct region exhibits aberrant cell
death. Over the past few decades, several therapeutic options have been
implicated for ischemic stroke. However, their use has been hampered owing to the
number of limitations that they possess. Ischemic penumbral neurons undergo
apoptosis and become dysfunctional; however, they are salvageable. Thus,
understanding the role of different cell death pathways is crucial to aid in the 
modern treatment of protecting apoptotic neurons.

Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.

Cell death is the ultimate form of cellular dysfunction, and is induced by a wide
range of stresses including genotoxic stresses. During genotoxic stress, two
opposite cellular reactions, cellular protection through DNA repair and
elimination of damaged cells by the induction of cell death, can occur in both
separate and simultaneous manners. ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase
(hereafter referred to as ATM) is a protein kinase that plays central roles in
the induction of cell death during genotoxic stresses. It has long been
considered that ATM mediates DNA damage-induced cell death through inducing
apoptosis. However, recent research progress in cell death modality is now
revealing ATM-dependent cell death pathways that consist of not only apoptosis
but also necroptosis, ferroptosis, and dysfunction of autophagy, a cellular
survival mechanism. In this short review, we intend to provide a brief outline of
cell death mechanisms in which ATM is involved, with emphasis on pathways other
than apoptosis.

Regulated cell death (RCD), also well-known as programmed cell death (PCD),
refers to the form of cell death that can be regulated by a variety of
biomacromolecules, which is distinctive from accidental cell death (ACD).
Accumulating evidence has revealed that RCD subroutines are the key features of
tumorigenesis, which may ultimately lead to the establishment of different
potential therapeutic strategies. Hitherto, targeting the subroutines of RCD with
pharmacological small-molecule compounds has been emerging as a promising
therapeutic avenue, which has rapidly progressed in many types of human cancers. 
Thus, in this review, we focus on summarizing not only the key apoptotic and
autophagy-dependent cell death signaling pathways, but the crucial pathways of
other RCD subroutines, including necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis,
parthanatos, entosis, NETosis and lysosome-dependent cell death (LCD) in cancer. 
Moreover, we further discuss the current situation of several small-molecule
compounds targeting the different RCD subroutines to improve cancer treatment,
such as single-target, dual or multiple-target small-molecule compounds, drug
combinations, and some new emerging therapeutic strategies that would together
shed new light on future directions to attack cancer cell vulnerabilities with
small-molecule drugs targeting RCD for therapeutic purposes.

Ferroptosis is a form of iron- and lipid peroxidation-mediated programmed cell
death that occurs widely in mammalian cells. However, this phenomenon is rarely
reported in unicellular eukaryotes. Here, we address whether ferroptosis occurs
in the model unicellular eukaryote Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe). Deletion
of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene ppr2 encoding as a general
mitochondrial translation factor required for mitochondrial translation disrupts 
iron homeostasis and induces oxidative stress, resulting in loss of cell
viability. The small-molecular ferroptosis inhibitors deferoxamine (DFO) and
ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) partially rescued the ppr2 deletion-induced cell death. The
amount of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker, in Δppr2 cells was higher
than that in wild type. Using C11-BODIPY 581/591, an oxidation-sensitive
fluorescent lipid peroxidation probe, we showed that Δppr2 cells have a large
amount of lipid peroxidation compared to wild-type cells. Deletion of ferric
reductase transmembrane component 1 (frp1) encoding S. pombe ferric reductase,
which is required for ferric iron uptake, partially rescued the cell death of
Δppr2 cells. Our results suggest that ppr2 deletion causes an imbalance in iron
homeostasis and redox, leading to ferroptosis-like cell death in S. pombe.

Programmed cell death is considered a key player in a variety of cellular
processes that helps to regulate tissue growth, embryogenesis, cell turnover,
immune response, and other biological processes. Among different types of cell
death, apoptosis has been studied widely, especially in the field of cancer
research to understand and analyse cellular mechanisms, and signaling pathways
that control cell cycle arrest. Hallmarks of different types of cell death have
been identified by following the patterns and events through microscopy.
Identified biomarkers have also supported drug development to induce cell death
in cancerous cells. There are various serological and microscopic techniques with
advantages and limitations, that are available and are being utilized to detect
and study the mechanism of cell death. The complexity of the mechanism and
difficulties in distinguishing among different types of programmed cell death
make it challenging to carry out the interventions and delay its progression. In 
this review, mechanisms of different forms of programmed cell death along with
their conventional and unconventional methods of detection of have been
critically reviewed systematically and categorized on the basis of morphological 
hallmarks and biomarkers to understand the principle, mechanism, application,
advantages and disadvantages of each method. Furthermore, a very comprehensive
comparative analysis has been drawn to highlight the most efficient and effective
methods of detection of programmed cell death, helping researchers to make a
reliable and prudent selection among the available methods of cell death assay.
Conclusively, how programmed cell death detection methods can be improved and can
provide information about distinctive stages of cell death detection have been
discussed.

Recognition of a pathogen by the plant immune system often triggers a form of
regulated cell death traditionally known as the hypersensitive response (HR).
This type of cell death occurs precisely at the site of pathogen recognition, and
it is restricted to a few cells. Extensive research has shed light on how plant
immune receptors are mechanistically activated. However, two central key
questions remain largely unresolved: how does cell death zonation take place, and
what are the mechanisms that underpin this phenomenon? Consequently, bona fide
transcriptional indicators of HR are lacking, which prevents deeper insight into 
its mechanisms before cell death becomes macroscopic and precludes early or live 
observation. In this study, to identify the transcriptional indicators of HR we
used the paradigmatic Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae pathosystem and
performed a spatiotemporally resolved gene expression analysis that compared
infected cells that will undergo HR upon pathogen recognition with bystander
cells that will stay alive and activate immunity. Our data revealed unique and
time-dependent differences in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes,
expression profiles, and biological processes derived from tissue undergoing HR
and that of its surroundings. Furthermore, we generated a pipeline based on
concatenated pairwise comparisons between time, zone, and treatment that enabled 
us to define 13 robust transcriptional HR markers. Among these genes, the
promoter of an uncharacterized AAA-ATPase was used to obtain a fluorescent
reporter transgenic line that displays a strong spatiotemporally resolved signal 
specifically in cells that will later undergo pathogen-triggered cell death. This
valuable set of genes can be used to define cells that are destined to die upon
infection with HR-triggering bacteria, opening new avenues for specific and/or
high-throughput techniques to study HR processes at a single-cell level.

Cell death is the ultimate end of a cell cycle that occurs in all living
organisms during development or responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In the 
course of evolution, plants and animals evolve various molecular mechanisms to
regulate cell death; however, some of them are conserved among both these
kingdoms. It was found that mammalian proapoptotic BCL-2 associated X (Bax)
protein, when expressed in plants, induces cell death, similar to hypersensitive 
response (HR). It was also shown that changes in the expression level of genes
encoding proteins involved in stress response or oxidative status regulation
mitigate Bax-induced plant cell death. In our study, we focused on the
evolutional compatibility of animal and plant cell death molecular mechanisms.
Therefore, we studied the deregulation of reactive oxygen species burst and
HR-like propagation in Arabidopsis thaliana expressing mammalian Bax. We were
able to diminish Bax-induced oxidative stress and HR progression through the
genetic cross with plants mutated in ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1),
which is a plant-positive HR regulator. Plants expressing the mouse Bax gene in
eds1-1 null mutant background demonstrated less pronounced cell death and
exhibited higher antioxidant system efficiency compared to Bax-expressing plants.
Moreover, eds1/Bax plants did not show HR marker genes induction, as in the case 
of the Bax-expressing line. The present study indicates some common molecular
features between animal and plant cell death regulation and can be useful to
better understand the evolution of cell death mechanisms in plants and animals.

Clitocybe nebularis lectin (CNL) is a GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-binding lectin that
exhibits an antiproliferative effect exclusively on the Jurkat leukemic T cell
line by provoking homotypic aggregation and dose-dependent cell death. Cell death
of Jurkat cells exhibited typical features of early apoptosis, but lacked the
activation of initiating and executing caspases. None of the features of
CNL-induced cell death were effectively blocked with the pan-caspase inhibitor or
different cysteine peptidase inhibitors. Furthermore, CNL binding induced Jurkat 
cells to release the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern molecule
high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). A plant lectin with similar glycan-binding
specificity, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) showed less selective toxicity 
and induced cell death in Jurkat, Tall-104, and Hut-87 cell lines. HMGB1 release 
was also detected when Jurkat cells were treated with WFA. We identified the CD45
and CD43 cell surface glycoproteins on Jurkat cells as the main targets for CNL
binding. However, the blockade of CD45 phosphatase activity failed to block
either CNL-induced homotypic agglutination or cell death. Overall, our results
indicate that CNL triggers atypical cell death selectively on Jurkat cells,
suggesting the potential applicability of CNL in novel strategies for treating
and/or detecting acute T cell leukemia.

Cell death is a critical process that occurs normally in health and disease.
However, its study is limited due to available technologies that only detect very
late stages in the process or specific death mechanisms. Here, we report the
development of a family of fluorescent biosensors called genetically encoded
death indicators (GEDIs). GEDIs specifically detect an intracellular Ca2+ level
that cells achieve early in the cell death process and that marks a stage at
which cells are irreversibly committed to die. The time-resolved nature of a GEDI
delineates a binary demarcation of cell life and death in real time,
reformulating the definition of cell death. We demonstrate that GEDIs acutely and
accurately report death of rodent and human neurons in vitro, and show that GEDIs
enable an automated imaging platform for single cell detection of neuronal death 
in vivo in zebrafish larvae. With a quantitative pseudo-ratiometric signal, GEDIs
facilitate high-throughput analysis of cell death in time-lapse imaging analysis,
providing the necessary resolution and scale to identify early factors leading to
cell death in studies of neurodegeneration.

Alveolar cells in the mammary gland: lineage commitment and cell death.

Watson CJ(1).

CB2 1QP, U.K.

The mammary gland provides a spectacular example of physiological cell death
whereby the cells that produce milk during lactation are removed swiftly,
efficiently, and without inducing inflammation upon the cessation of lactation.
The milk-producing cells arise primarily during pregnancy and comprise the
alveolar lineage that is specified by signalling pathways and factors that are
activated in response to pregnancy hormones. There are at least two alveolar
sub-lineages, one of which is marked by the presence of binucleate cells that are
especially susceptible to programmed cell death during involution. This process
of post-lactational regression, or involution, is carefully orchestrated and
occurs in two phases, the first results in a rapid switch in cell fate with the
secretory epithelial cells becoming phagocytes whereupon they destroy dead and
dying cells from milk. This reversible phase is followed by the second phase that
is marked by an influx of immune cells and a remodelling of the gland to replace 
the alveolar cells with re-differentiated adipocytes, resulting in a return to
the pre-pregnant state in preparation for any subsequent pregnancies. The mouse
mammary gland provides an excellent experimental tool with which to investigate
lineage commitment and the mechanisms of programmed cell death that occur in a
normal physiological process. Importantly, involution has highlighted a role for 
lysoptosis, a mechanism of cell death that is mediated by lysosomal cathepsins
and their endogenous inhibitors, serpins. In this review, I discuss alveolar
lineage commitment during pregnancy and the programmed cell death pathways that
destroy these cells during involution.

Comparative transient expression analyses on two conserved effectors of
Colletotrichum orbiculare reveal their distinct cell death-inducing activities
between Nicotiana benthamiana and melon.

Colletotrichum orbiculare infects cucurbits, such as cucumber and melon (Cucumis 
melo), as well as the model Solanaceae plant Nicotiana benthamiana, by secreting 
an arsenal of effectors that suppress the immunity of these distinct plants. Two 
conserved effectors of C. orbiculare, called NLP1 and NIS1, induce cell death
responses in N. benthamiana, but it is unclear whether they exhibit the same
activity in Cucurbitaceae plants. In this study, we established a new
Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system to investigate the cell
death-inducing activity of NLP1 and NIS1 in melon. NLP1 strongly induced cell
death in melon but, in contrast to the effects seen in N. benthamiana, mutations 
either in the heptapeptide motif or in the putative glycosylinositol
phosphorylceramide-binding site did not cancel its cell death-inducing activity
in melon. Furthermore, NLP1 lacking the signal peptide caused cell death in melon
but not in N. benthamiana. Study of the transient expression of NIS1 also
revealed that, unlike in N. benthamiana, NIS1 did not induce cell death in melon.
In contrast, NIS1 suppressed flg22-induced reactive oxygen species generation in 
melon, as seen in N. benthamiana. These findings indicate distinct cell
death-inducing activities of NLP1 and NIS1 in these two plant species that C.
orbiculare infects.

Propyl gallate (PG) has an anti-growth effect in lung cancer cells. The present
study investigated the effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; MEK,
JNK, and p38) inhibitors on PG-treated Calu-6 and A549 lung cancer cells in
relation to cell death as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione
(GSH) levels. PG induced cell death in both Calu-6 and A549 lung cancer cells at 
24 h, which was accompanied by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP;
ΔΨm). All of the tested MAPK inhibitors increased cell death in both PG-treated
lung cancer cell lines. In particular, MEK inhibitor strongly enhanced cell death
and MMP (ΔΨm) loss in PG-treated Calu-6 cells and p38 inhibitor had the same
effects in A549 cells as well. PG increased ROS levels and caused GSH depletion
in both cell lines at 24 h. MAPK inhibitors increased O2•- levels and GSH
depletion in PG-treated Calu-6 cells, and JNK and p38 inhibitors increased ROS
levels and GSH depletion in PG-treated A549 cells. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors
increased cell death in PG-treated Calu-6 and A549 lung cancer cells. Enhanced
cell death and GSH depletion in Calu-6 cells caused by the MEK inhibitor were
related to increased O2•- levels, and the effects of the p38 inhibitor in A549
cells were correlated with increased general ROS levels.

Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; RIPK1) is a key regulator of multiple
signaling pathways that mediate inflammatory responses and cell death. TNF-TNFR1 
triggered signaling complex formation, subsequent NF-κB and MAPK activation and
induction of cell death involve RIPK1 ubiquitination at several lysine residues
including Lys376 and Lys115. Here we show that mutating the ubiquitination site
K376 of RIPK1 (K376R) in mice activates cell death resulting in embryonic
lethality. In contrast to Ripk1K376R/K376R mice, Ripk1K115R/K115R mice reached
adulthood and showed slightly higher responsiveness to TNF-induced death. Cell
death observed in Ripk1K376R/K376R embryos relied on RIPK1 kinase activity as
administration of RIPK1 inhibitor GNE684 to pregnant heterozygous mice
effectively blocked cell death and prolonged survival. Embryonic lethality of
Ripk1K376R/K376R mice was prevented by the loss of TNFR1, or by simultaneous
deletion of caspase-8 and RIPK3. Interestingly, elimination of the wild-type
allele from adult Ripk1K376R/cko mice was tolerated. However, adult
Ripk1K376R/cko mice were exquisitely sensitive to TNF-induced hypothermia and
associated lethality. Absence of the K376 ubiquitination site diminished
K11-linked, K63-linked, and linear ubiquitination of RIPK1, and promoted the
assembly of death-inducing cellular complexes, suggesting that multiple ubiquitin
linkages contribute to the stability of the RIPK1 signaling complex that
stimulates NF-κB and MAPK activation. In contrast, mutating K115 did not affect
RIPK1 ubiquitination or TNF stimulated NF-κB and MAPK signaling. Overall, our
data indicate that selective impairment of RIPK1 ubiquitination can lower the
threshold for RIPK1 activation by TNF resulting in cell death and embryonic
lethality.

Signaling via death receptor family members such as TNF-R1 mediates pleiotropic
biological outcomes ranging from inflammation and proliferation to cell death.
Pro-survival signaling is mediated via TNF-R1 complex I at the cellular plasma
membrane. Cell death induction requires complex IIa/b or necrosome formation,
which occurs in the cytoplasm. In many cell types, full apoptotic or necroptotic 
cell death induction requires the internalization of TNF-R1 and receptosome
formation to properly relay the signal inside the cell. We interrogated the role 
of the enzyme A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)/TACE (TNF-α
converting enzyme) in death receptor signaling in human hematopoietic cells,
using pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation. We show that in U937 and
Jurkat cells the absence of ADAM17 does not abrogate, but rather increases TNF
mediated cell death. Likewise, cell death triggered via DR3 is enhanced in U937
cells lacking ADAM17. We identified ADAM17 as the key molecule that fine-tunes
death receptor signaling. A better understanding of cell fate decisions made via 
the receptors of the TNF-R1 superfamily may enable us, in the future, to more
efficiently treat infectious and inflammatory diseases or cancer.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes 10 to 15% of all breast cancer
and is associated with worse prognosis than other subtypes of breast cancer.
Current therapies are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, 
leaving a need for targeted therapeutics to improve outcomes for TNBC patients.
Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is a nonenveloped, segmented, double-stranded 
RNA virus in the Reoviridae family. Reovirus preferentially kills transformed
cells and is in clinical trials to assess its efficacy against several types of
cancer. We previously engineered a reassortant reovirus, r2Reovirus, that infects
TNBC cells more efficiently and induces cell death with faster kinetics than
parental reoviruses. In this study, we sought to understand the mechanisms by
which r2Reovirus induces cell death in TNBC cells. We show that r2Reovirus
infection of TNBC cells of a mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) lineage downregulates
the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase pathway 
and induces nonconventional cell death that is caspase-dependent but caspase
3-independent. Infection of different MSL lineage TNBC cells with r2Reovirus
results in caspase 3-dependent cell death. We map the enhanced oncolytic
properties of r2Reovirus in TNBC to epistatic interactions between the type 3
Dearing M2 gene segment and type 1 Lang genes. These findings suggest that the
genetic composition of the host cell impacts the mechanism of reovirus-induced
cell death in TNBC. Together, our data show that understanding host and virus
determinants of cell death can identify novel properties and interactions between
host and viral gene products that can be exploited for the development of
improved viral oncolytics.IMPORTANCE TNBC is unresponsive to hormone therapies,
leaving patients afflicted with this disease with limited treatment options. We
previously engineered an oncolytic reovirus (r2Reovirus) with enhanced infective 
and cytotoxic properties in TNBC cells. However, how r2Reovirus promotes TNBC
cell death is not known. In this study, we show that reassortant r2Reovirus can
promote nonconventional caspase-dependent but caspase 3-independent cell death
and that the mechanism of cell death depends on the genetic composition of the
host cell. We also map the enhanced oncolytic properties of r2Reovirus in TNBC to
interactions between a type 3 M2 gene segment and type 1 genes. Our data show
that understanding the interplay between the host cell environment and the
genetic composition of oncolytic viruses is crucial for the development of
efficacious viral oncolytics.

Transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channels are members of the
transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, a family of evolutionarily conserved
integral membrane proteins. TRPM channels are nonselective cation channels,
mediating the influx of various ions including Ca2+, Na+ and Zn2+. The function
of TRPM channels is vital for cell proliferation, cell development and cell
death. Cell death is a key procedure during embryonic development, organism
homeostasis, aging and disease. The category of cell death modalities, beyond the
traditionally defined concepts of necrosis, autophagy, and apoptosis, were
extended with the discovery of pyroptosis, necroptosis and ferroptosis. As
upstream signaling regulators of cell death, TRPM channels have been involved
inrelevant pathologies. In this review, we introduced several cell death
modalities, then summarized the contribution of TRPM channels (especially TRPM2
and TRPM7) to different cell death modalities and discussed the underlying
regulatory mechanisms. Our work highlighted the possibility of TRPM channels as
potential therapeutic targets in cell death-related diseases.

Netherlands.

Regulated or programmed cell death plays a critical role in the development and
tissue organization and function. In addition, it is intrinsically connected with
immunity and host defence. An increasing cellular and molecular findings cause a 
change in the concept of cell death, revealing an expanding network of regulated 
cell death modalities and their biochemical programmes. Likewise, recent
evidences demonstrate the interconnection between cell death pathways and how
they are involved in different immune mechanisms. This work provides an overview 
of the main cell death programmes and their implication in innate immunity not
only as an immunogenic/inflammatory process, but also as an active defence
strategy during immune response and at the same time as a regulatory mechanism.

Innate Immune Cell Death in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's Disease.

38105, USA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder molecularly
characterized by the formation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and type 2
microtubule-associated protein (Tau) abnormalities. Multiple studies have shown
that many of the brain's immunological cells, specifically microglia and
astrocytes, are involved in AD pathogenesis. Cells of the innate immune system
play an essential role in eliminating pathogens but also regulate brain
homeostasis and AD. When activated, innate immune cells can cause programmed cell
death through multiple pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis,
and PANoptosis. The cell death often results in the release of proinflammatory
cytokines that propagate the innate immune response and can eliminate Aβ plaques 
and aggregated Tau proteins. However, chronic neuroinflammation, which can result
from cell death, has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and can worsen AD.
Therefore, the innate immune response must be tightly balanced to appropriately
clear these AD-related structural abnormalities without inducing chronic
neuroinflammation. In this review, we discuss neuroinflammation, innate immune
responses, inflammatory cell death pathways, and cytokine secretion as they
relate to AD. Therapeutic strategies targeting these innate immune cell death
mechanisms will be critical to consider for future preventive or palliative
treatments for AD.

Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is a critical pathological trigger leading to
irreversible visual impairment and blindness after optic nerve (ON) injury. Yet, 
there is still no effective clinical treatment to rescue RGC death after ON
injury. Understanding the involvement of different modes of cell death post-ON
injury could facilitate the development of targeting treatments against RGC
death. Herein we aimed to characterize the regulation of 11 modes of cell death
simultaneously and longitudinally in mouse retina post-ON injury. The number of
RGCs gradually decreased from Day 3-14 in mice post-ON injury. Increase in the
apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), autolysis (cleaved cathespin B) and pyroptosis
(cleaved caspase-1) marker expression in the retina began at Day 3 post-ON
injury. Meanwhile, the markers for autophagy (Atg7 and Becn1) and phagocytosis
(Mfge8 and Mertk) were downregulated from Day 1 to Day 5. Additionally, the
expression of ferroptosis marker (4-hydroxynonenal) was upregulated from Day 7 to
Day 14 post-ON injury following the early reduction of Gpx4. Yet, the reduction
of parthanatos, sarmoptosis, and mitochondrial permeable transition could be
related to autophagy and apoptosis. The markers for necroptosis did not show
significant changes post-ON injury. In summary, this study revealed that the
activation of apoptosis, autolysis, pyroptosis and ferroptosis, together with the
early downregulation of autophagy and phagocytosis, are the major modes of cell
death involved in the RGC death post-ON injury. Simultaneously targeting multiple
modes of cell death at different time courses could be a potential treatment
approach against RGC death for traumatic optic neuropathy.

Identification of cell death mechanisms, particularly distinguishing between
apoptotic versus nonapoptotic pathways, is of paramount importance for a wide
range of applications related to cell signaling, interaction with pathogens,
therapeutic processes, drug discovery, drug resistance, and even pathogenesis of 
diseases like cancers and neurogenerative disease among others. Here, we present 
a novel high-throughput method of identifying apoptotic versus necrotic versus
other nonapoptotic cell death processes, based on lensless digital holography.
This method relies on identification of the temporal changes in the morphological
features of mammalian cells, which are unique to each cell death processes.
Different cell death processes were induced by known cytotoxic agents. A deep
learning-based approach was used to automatically classify the cell death
mechanism (apoptotic vs necrotic vs nonapoptotic) with more than 93% accuracy.
This label free approach can provide a low cost (<$250) alternative to some of
the currently available high content imaging-based screening tools.

Life and Death Decisions-The Many Faces of Autophagy in Cell Survival and Cell
Death.

Autophagy is a process conserved from yeast to humans. Since the discovery of
autophagy, its physiological role in cell survival and cell death has been
intensively investigated. The inherent ability of the autophagy machinery to
sequester, deliver, and degrade cytoplasmic components enables autophagy to
participate in cell survival and cell death in multiple ways. The primary role of
autophagy is to send cytoplasmic components to the vacuole or lysosomes for
degradation. By fine-tuning autophagy, the cell regulates the removal and
recycling of cytoplasmic components in response to various stress or signals.
Recent research has shown the implications of the autophagy machinery in other
pathways independent of lysosomal degradation, expanding the pro-survival role of
autophagy. Autophagy also facilitates certain forms of regulated cell death. In
addition, there is complex crosstalk between autophagy and regulated cell death
pathways, with a number of genes shared between them, further suggesting a deeper
connection between autophagy and cell death. Finally, the mitochondrion presents 
an example where the cell utilizes autophagy to strike a balance between cell
survival and cell death. In this review, we consider the current knowledge on the
physiological role of autophagy as well as its regulation and discuss the
multiple functions of autophagy in cell survival and cell death.

Balancing cell survival and cell death is fundamental to development and
homeostasis. Cell death is regulated by multiple interconnected signaling
pathways and molecular mechanisms. Regulated cell death (RCD) is implicated in
fundamental processes such as organogenesis and tissue remodeling, removal of
unnecessary structures or cells, and regulation of cell numbers. RCD can also be 
triggered by exogenous perturbations of the intracellular or extracellular
microenvironment when the adaptive processes that respond to stress fail. During 
the past few years, many novel forms of non-apoptotic RCD have been identified,
and the characterization of RCD mechanisms at a molecular level has deepened our 
understanding of diseases encountered in human and veterinary medicine. Given the
complexity of these processes, it has become clear that the identification of RCD
cannot be based simply on morphologic characteristics and that descriptive and
diagnostic terms presently used by pathologists-such as individual cell apoptosis
or necrosis-appear inadequate and possibly misleading. In this review, the
current understanding of the molecular machinery of each type of non-apoptotic
RCD mechanisms is outlined. Due to the continuous discovery of new mechanisms or 
nuances of previously described processes, the limitations of the terms apoptosis
and necrosis to indicate microscopic findings are also reported. In addition, the
need for a standard panel of biomarkers and functional tests to adequately
characterize the underlying RCD and its role as a mechanism of disease is
considered.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is mainly caused by
deficiency of polycystin-1 (PC1) or polycystin-2 (PC2). Altered autophagy has
recently been implicated in ADPKD progression, but its exact regulation by PC1
and PC2 remains unclear. We therefore investigated cell death and survival during
nutritional stress in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCDs),
either wild-type (WT) or lacking PC1 (PC1KO) or PC2 (PC2KO), and human
urine-derived proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) from early-stage ADPKD
patients with PC1 mutations versus healthy individuals. Basal autophagy was
enhanced in PC1-deficient cells. Similarly, following starvation, autophagy was
enhanced and cell death reduced when PC1 was reduced. Autophagy inhibition
reduced cell death resistance in PC1KO mIMCDs to the WT level, implying that PC1 
promotes autophagic cell survival. Although PC2 expression was increased in PC1KO
mIMCDs, PC2 knockdown did not result in reduced autophagy. PC2KO mIMCDs displayed
lower basal autophagy, but more autophagy and less cell death following chronic
starvation. This could be reversed by overexpression of PC1 in PC2KO. Together,
these findings indicate that PC1 levels are partially coupled to PC2 expression, 
and determine the transition from renal cell survival to death, leading to
enhanced survival of ADPKD cells during nutritional stress.

Tau aggregation and its relation to selected forms of neuronal cell death.

Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0AH, U.K.

How neurons die in neurodegenerative diseases is still unknown. The distinction
between apoptosis as a genetically controlled mechanism, and necrosis, which was 
viewed as an unregulated process, has blurred with the ever-increasing number of 
necrotic-like death subroutines underpinned by genetically defined pathways. It
is therefore pertinent to ask whether any of them apply to neuronal cell death in
tauopathies. Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent tauopathy,
tauopathies comprise an array of over 30 diseases in which the cytoplasmic
protein tau aggregates in neurons, and also, in some diseases, in glia. Animal
models have sought to distil the contribution of tau aggregation to the cell
death process but despite intensive research, no one mechanism of cell death has 
been unequivocally defined. The process of tau aggregation, and the fibrillar
structures that form, touch on so many cellular functions that there is unlikely 
to be a simple linear pathway of death; as one is blocked another is likely to
take the lead. It is timely to ask how far we have advanced into defining whether
any of the molecular players in the new death subroutines participate in the
death process. Here we briefly review the currently known cell death routines and
explore what is known about their participation in tau aggregation-related cell
death. We highlight the involvement of cell autonomous and the more recent
non-cell autonomous pathways that may enhance tau-aggregate toxicity, and discuss
recent findings that implicate microglial phagocytosis of live neurons with tau
aggregates as a mechanism of death.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus member of the Flaviviridae family that causes
severe congenital brain anomalies in infected fetuses. The key target cells of
ZIKV infection, human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), are highly permissive to
infection that causes the inhibition of cell proliferation and induces cell
death. We have previously shown that pharmaceutical-grade heparin inhibits
virus-induced cell death with negligible effects on in vitro virus replication in
ZIKV-infected hNPCs at the "high" multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Here, we 
show that heparin inhibits formation of ZIKV-induced intracellular vacuoles, a
signature of paraptosis, and inhibits necrosis and apoptosis of hNPCs grown as
neurospheres (NS). To test whether heparin preserved the differentiation of
ZIKV-infected hNPCs into neuroglial cells, hNPCs were infected at the MOI of
0.001. In this experimental condition, heparin inhibited ZIKV replication by ca. 
2 log10, mostly interfering with virion attachment, while maintaining its
protective effect against ZIKV-induced cytopathicity. Heparin preserved
differentiation into neuroglial cells of hNPCs that were obtained from either
human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) or by fetal tissue. Quite
surprisingly, multiple additions of heparin to hNPCs enabled prolonged virus
replication while preventing virus-induced cytopathicity. Collectively, these
results highlight the potential neuroprotective effect of heparin that could
serve as a lead compound to develop novel agents for preventing the damage of
ZIKV infection on the developing brain. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a neurotropic virus
that invades neural progenitor cells (NPCs), causing inhibition of their
proliferation and maturation into neurons and glial cells. We have shown
previously that heparin, an anticoagulant also used widely during pregnancy,
prevents ZIKV-induced cell death with negligible inhibition of virus replication.
Here, we demonstrate that heparin also exerts antiviral activity against ZIKV
replication using a much lower infectious inoculum. Moreover, heparin interferes 
with different modalities of virus-induced cell death. Finally, heparin-induced
prevention of virus-induced NPC death allows their differentiation into
neuroglial cells despite the intracellular accumulation of virions. These results
highlight the potential use of heparin, or pharmacological agents derived from
it, in pregnant women to prevent the devastating effects of ZIKV infection on the
developing brain of their fetuses.

Programmed cell death pathways eliminate infected cells and regulate
infection-associated inflammation during pathogen invasion. Cytomegaloviruses
encode several distinct suppressors that block intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic
apoptosis, and necroptosis, pathways that impact pathogenesis of this ubiquitous 
herpesvirus. Here, we expanded the understanding of three cell autonomous
suppression mechanisms on which murine cytomegalovirus relies: (i) M38.5-encoded 
viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA), a BAX suppressor that
functions in concert with M41.1-encoded viral inhibitor of BAK oligomerization
(vIBO), (ii) M36-encoded viral inhibitor of caspase-8 activation (vICA), and
(iii) M45-encoded viral inhibitor of RIP/RHIM activation (vIRA). Following
infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages, the virus initially deflected
receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3-dependent necroptosis, the most
potent of the three cell death pathways. This process remained independent of
caspase-8, although suppression of this apoptotic protease enhances necroptosis
in most cell types. Second, the virus deflected TNF-mediated extrinsic apoptosis,
a pathway dependent on autocrine TNF production by macrophages that proceeds
independently of mitochondrial death machinery or RIPK3. Third, cytomegalovirus
deflected BCL-2 family protein-dependent mitochondrial cell death through
combined TNF-dependent and -independent signaling even in the absence of RIPK1,
RIPK3, and caspase-8. Furthermore, each of these cell death pathways dictated a
distinct pattern of cytokine and chemokine activation. Therefore, cytomegalovirus
employs sequential, non-redundant suppression strategies to specifically modulate
the timing and execution of necroptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, and intrinsic
apoptosis within infected cells to orchestrate virus control and
infection-dependent inflammation. Virus-encoded death suppressors together hold
control over an intricate network that upends host defense and supports
pathogenesis in the intact mammalian host.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized predominantly by
non-apoptotic forms of hepatocyte cell death. Necroptosis is a form of programmed
lytic cell death in which receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1, RIPK3 and
phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like (pMLKL) are key components. This 
study was performed to determine the role of RIPK1 mediated cell death in ACLF.
RIPK3 plasma levels and hepatic expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and pMLKL were
measured in healthy volunteers, stable patients with cirrhosis, and in
hospitalized cirrhotic patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis, with and
without ACLF (AD). The role of necroptosis in ACLF was studied in two animal
models of ACLF using inhibitors of RIPK1, necrostatin-1 (NEC-1) and SML2100
(RIPA56). Plasma RIPK3 levels predicted the risk of 28- and 90-day mortality
(AUROC, 0.653 (95%CI 0.530-0.776), 0.696 (95%CI 0.593-0.799)] and also the
progression of patients from no ACLF to ACLF [0.744 (95%CI 0.593-0.895)] and the 
results were validated in a 2nd patient cohort. This pattern was replicated in a 
rodent model of ACLF that was induced by administration of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) to bile-duct ligated rats and carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis mice
administered galactosamine (CCL4/GalN). Suppression of caspase-8 activity in ACLF
rodent model was observed suggesting a switch from caspase-dependent cell death
to necroptosis. NEC-1 treatment prior to administration of LPS significantly
reduced the severity of ACLF manifested by reduced liver, kidney, and brain
injury mirrored by reduced hepatic and renal cell death. Similar
hepato-protective effects were observed with RIPA56 in a murine model of ACLF
induced by CCL4/GalN. These data demonstrate for the first time the importance of
RIPK1 mediated cell death in human and rodent ACLF. Inhibition of RIPK1 is a
potential novel therapeutic approach to prevent progression of susceptible
patients from no ACLF to ACLF.

Cell surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activate immune responses that 
can include the hypersensitive cell death. However, the pathways that link PRRs
to the cell death response are poorly understood. Here, we show that the cell
surface receptor-like protein Cf-4 requires the intracellular nucleotide-binding 
domain leucine-rich repeat containing receptor (NLR) NRC3 to trigger a confluent 
cell death response upon detection of the fungal effector Avr4 in leaves of
Nicotiana benthamiana. This NRC3 activity requires an intact N-terminal MADA
motif, a conserved signature of coiled-coil (CC)-type plant NLRs that is required
for resistosome-mediated immune responses. A chimeric protein with the N-terminal
α1 helix of Arabidopsis ZAR1 swapped into NRC3 retains the capacity to mediate
Cf-4 hypersensitive cell death. Pathogen effectors acting as suppressors of NRC3 
can suppress Cf-4-triggered hypersensitive cell-death. Our findings link the NLR 
resistosome model to the hypersensitive cell death caused by a cell surface PRR.

BACKGROUND: Copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) are known to trigger
cytotoxicity in a variety of cell models, but the mechanism of cell death remains
unknown. Here we addressed the mechanism of cytotoxicity in macrophages exposed
to CuO NPs versus copper chloride (CuCl2).
METHODS: The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was used as an in vitro model.
Particle uptake and the cellular dose of Cu were investigated by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS), respectively. The deposition of Cu in lysosomes isolated from
macrophages was also determined by ICP-MS. Cell viability (metabolic activity)
was assessed using the Alamar Blue assay, and oxidative stress was monitored by a
variety of methods including a luminescence-based assay for cellular glutathione 
(GSH), and flow cytometry-based detection of mitochondrial superoxide and
mitochondrial membrane potential. Protein aggregation was determined by confocal 
microscopy using an aggresome-specific dye and protein misfolding was determined 
by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Lastly, proteasome activity was
investigated using a fluorometric assay.
RESULTS: We observed rapid cellular uptake of CuO NPs in macrophages with
deposition in lysosomes. CuO NP-elicited cell death was characterized by
mitochondrial swelling with signs of oxidative stress including the production of
mitochondrial superoxide and cellular depletion of GSH. We also observed a
dose-dependent accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and loss of proteasomal
function in CuO NP-exposed cells, and we could demonstrate misfolding and
mitochondrial translocation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a Cu/Zn-dependent
enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the defense against oxidative stress. The
chelation of copper ions using tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) prevented cell death
whereas inhibition of the cellular SOD1 chaperone aggravated toxicity. Moreover, 
CuO NP-triggered cell death was insensitive to the pan-caspase inhibitor,
zVAD-fmk, and to wortmannin, an inhibitor of autophagy, implying that this was a 
non-apoptotic cell death. ZnO NPs, on the other hand, triggered autophagic cell
death.
CONCLUSIONS: CuO NPs undergo dissolution in lysosomes leading to copper-dependent
macrophage cell death characterized by protein misfolding and proteasomal
insufficiency. Specifically, we present novel evidence for Cu-induced SOD1
misfolding which accords with the pronounced oxidative stress observed in CuO
NP-exposed macrophages. These results are relevant for our understanding of the
consequences of inadvertent human exposure to CuO NPs.

Death is an important part of an organism's existence and also marks the end of
life. On a cellular level, death involves the execution of complex processes,
which can be classified into different types depending on their characteristics. 
Despite their "simple" lifestyle, fungi carry out highly specialized and
sophisticated mechanisms to regulate the way their cells die, and the pathways
underlying these mechanisms are comparable with those of plants and metazoans.
This review focuses on regulated cell death in fungi and discusses the evidence
for the occurrence of apoptotic-like, necroptosis-like, pyroptosis-like death,
and the role of the NLR proteins in fungal cell death. We also describe recent
data on meiotic drive elements involved in "spore killing" and the molecular
basis of allorecognition-related cell death during cell fusion of genetically
dissimilar cells. Finally, we discuss how fungal regulated cell death can be
relevant in developing strategies to avoid resistance and tolerance to antifungal
agents.

BACKGROUND: Unraveling the mystery of cell death is one of the most fundamental
progresses of life sciences during the past decades. Regulated cell death (RCD)
or programmed cell death (PCD) is not only essential in embryonic development,
but also plays an important role in the occurrence and progression of diseases,
especially cancers. Escaping of cell death is one of hallmarks of cancer.
MAIN BODY: Pyroptosis is an inflammatory cell death usually caused by microbial
infection, accompanied by activation of inflammasomes and maturation of
pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18).
Gasdermin family proteins are the executors of pyroptosis. Cytotoxic N-terminal
of gasdermins generated from caspases or granzymes proteases mediated cleavage of
gasdermin proteins oligomerizes and forms pore across cell membrane, leading to
release of IL-1β, IL-18. Pyroptosis exerts tumor suppression function and evokes 
anti-tumor immune responses. Therapeutic regimens, including chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, targeted therapy and immune therapy, induce pyroptosis in cancer,
which potentiate local and systemic anti-tumor immunity. On the other hand,
pyroptosis of normal cells attributes to side effects of anti-cancer therapies.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms of pyroptosis
and the tumor suppressive function of pyroptosis. We discuss the attribution of
pyroptosis in reprogramming tumor microenvironments and restoration of anti-tumor
immunity and its potential application in cancer immune therapy.

The production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during programmed cell death 
(PCD) is still insufficiently studied and their implication in the process is not
well understood. The present study demonstrates that the release of VOSCs with
presumed antioxidant capacity (methanethiol, dimethylsulfide and
dimethyldisulfide) accompanies the cell death in chemical-stressed tobacco BY-2
suspension cultured cells. The cells were exposed to cell death inducers of
biotic nature mastoparan (MP, wasp venom) and camptothecin (CPT, alkaloid), and
to the abiotic stress agent CdSO4. The VOCs emission was monitored by
proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). The three chemicals induced 
PCD expressing apoptotic-like phenotype. The identified VOSCs were emitted in
response to MP and CPT but not in presence of Cd. The VOSCs production occurred
within few hours after the administration of the elicitors, peaked up when 20-50 
% of the cells were dead and further levelled off with cell death advancement.
This suggests that VOSCs with antioxidant activity may contribute to alleviation 
of cell death-associated oxidative stress at medium severity of cell death in
response to the stress factors of biotic origin. The findings provide novel
information about cell death defence mechanisms in chemical-challenged BY-2 cells
and show that PCD related VOSCs synthesis depends on the type of inducer.

Fas-ligand/CD178 belongs to the TNF family proteins and is the well-characterized
inducer of cell death. We showed previously that the interaction of Fas-ligand
and caveolin-1 is necessary for Fas-ligand translocation to rafts, and the
subsequent induction of Fas-ligand-dependent cell death. Both molecules can
undergo phosphorylation, however the role of the phosphorylation state of
Fas-ligand and caveolin-1 in their physical association, and consequently in of
Fas - mediated cell death induction is currently unknown. In this study, we show 
that in control cells Fas-ligand interaction with caveolin-1 is not observed, and
both molecules are phosphorylated. The intracellular part of Fas-ligand was shown
to form a complex with p59Fyn-kinase. Upon cell death activation, the expression 
and activity of p59Fyn-kinase decreases substantially, leading to the disruption 
of Fas-ligand - p59Fyn-kinase association, dephosphorylation of Fas-ligand and
caveolin-1, and formation of a complex between them (Fas-ligand - caveolin-1).
The analysis of the effects of kinase and phosphatase inhibitors revealed that
phosphorylation of Fas-ligand and caveolin-1 at tyrosine residues suppressed
Fas-mediated cell death. Thus, dephosphorylation of Fas-ligand and caveolin-1 is 
critical for triggering Fas-ligand-mediated apoptotic pathway and cell death
execution.

Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cathepsin release typifies
lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD). However, LMP occurs in most regulated cell 
death programs suggesting LDCD is not an independent cell death pathway, but is
conscripted to facilitate the final cellular demise by other cell death routines.
Previously, we demonstrated that Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) null for a
cysteine protease inhibitor, srp-6, undergo a specific LDCD pathway characterized
by LMP and cathepsin-dependent cytoplasmic proteolysis. We designated this cell
death routine, lysoptosis, to distinguish it from other pathways employing LMP.
In this study, mouse and human epithelial cells lacking srp-6 homologues,
mSerpinb3a and SERPINB3, respectively, demonstrated a lysoptosis phenotype
distinct from other cell death pathways. Like in C. elegans, this pathway
depended on LMP and released cathepsins, predominantly cathepsin L. These studies
suggested that lysoptosis is an evolutionarily-conserved eukaryotic LDCD that
predominates in the absence of neutralizing endogenous inhibitors.

Rhinovirus and Cell Death.

Australia.

Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the etiological agents of upper respiratory tract
infections, particularly the common cold. Infections in the lower respiratory
tract is shown to cause severe disease and exacerbations in asthma and COPD
patients. Viruses being obligate parasites, hijack host cell pathways such as
programmed cell death to suppress host antiviral responses and prolong viral
replication and propagation. RVs are non-enveloped positive sense RNA viruses
with a lifecycle fully contained within the cytoplasm. Despite decades of study, 
the details of how RVs exit the infected cell are still unclear. There are some
diverse studies that suggest a possible role for programmed cell death. In this
review, we aimed to consolidate current literature on the impact of RVs on cell
death to inform future research on the topic. We searched peer reviewed English
language literature in the past 21 years for studies on the interaction with and 
modulation of cell death pathways by RVs, placing it in the context of the
broader knowledge of these interconnected pathways from other systems. Our review
strongly suggests a role for necroptosis and/or autophagy in RV release, with the
caveat that all the literature is based on RV-A and RV-B strains, with no studies
to date examining the interaction of RV-C strains with cell death pathways.

BACKGROUND: Animals and plants diverged over one billion years ago and evolved
unique mechanisms for many cellular processes, including cell death. One of the
most well-studied cell death programmes in animals, apoptosis, involves gradual
cell dismantling and engulfment of cellular fragments, apoptotic bodies, through 
phagocytosis. However, rigid cell walls prevent plant cell fragmentation and thus
apoptosis is not applicable for executing cell death in plants. Furthermore,
plants are devoid of the key components of apoptotic machinery, including
phagocytosis as well as caspases and Bcl-2 family proteins. Nevertheless, the
concept of plant "apoptosis-like programmed cell death" (AL-PCD) is widespread.
This is largely due to superficial morphological resemblances between plant cell 
death and apoptosis, and in particular between protoplast shrinkage in plant
cells killed by various stimuli and animal cell volume decrease preceding
fragmentation into apoptotic bodies.
RESULTS: Here, we provide a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of cytological
and biochemical events occurring in plant cells subjected to heat shock at
40-55 °C and 85 °C, the experimental conditions typically used to trigger AL-PCD 
and necrotic cell death, respectively. We show that cell death under both
conditions was not accompanied by membrane blebbing or formation of apoptotic
bodies, as would be expected during apoptosis. Instead, we observed instant and
irreversible permeabilization of the plasma membrane and ATP depletion. These
processes did not depend on mitochondrial functionality or the presence of Ca2+
and could not be prevented by an inhibitor of ferroptosis. We further reveal that
the lack of protoplast shrinkage at 85 °C, the only striking morphological
difference between cell deaths induced by 40-55 °C or 85 °C heat shock, is a
consequence of the fixative effect of the high temperature on intracellular
contents.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that heat shock-induced cell death is an
energy-independent process best matching definition of necrosis. Although the
initial steps of this necrotic cell death could be genetically regulated,
classifying it as apoptosis or AL-PCD is a terminological misnomer. Our work
supports the viewpoint that apoptosis is not conserved across animal and plant
kingdoms and demonstrates the importance of focusing on plant-specific aspects of
cell death pathways.

Bladder cancer is one of the most common genitourinary malignant cancers
worldwide. Cell death processes, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necrosis, 
provide novel clinical and immunological insights promoting the management of
precision medicine. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the transcriptomic
profile of signatures in cell death pathways with significant prognostic
implications in patients with bladder cancer from multiple independent cohorts (n
= 1999). First, genes involved in apoptosis (n = 19), ferroptosis (n = 31), and
necrosis (n = 6) were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic implications in bladder
cancer. Significant genes were included to establish the cell-death index (CDI)
of 36 genes that distinguished patients according to high and low risks. Survival
analysis using the Kaplan-Meier curves clustered patients based on overall
survival (18.8 vs. 96.7 months; hazard model [HR] = 3.12, P<00001). Cox
proportional hazard model was significantly associated with a higher risk of
mortality using 10 external independent cohorts in patients with CDIhigh (HR =
1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.62). To explore immune parameters associated with CDI,
microenvironment cell-population-counter algorithms indicated increased
intratumoral heterogeneity and macrophage/monocyte infiltration and CD8+ T cells 
in patients with CDIhigh group. Besides, the CDIhigh group showed an increased
expression of the following immune checkpoints: CD276, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and T-cell 
exhaustion signatures. Cytokine expression analysis revealed the highest
association of IL-9R, IL-17A, IL-17F, GDF7, and IFNW1 with the high-risk group.
In addition, 42 patients with BCa receiving immunotherapies were enrolled from a 
real-world cohort, and expression patterns of three CDI hub genes (DRD5, SCL2A14,
and IGF1) were detected using immunohistochemical staining. Patients with
triple-negative staining of tumor tissues had significantly higher
tumor-associated macrophage abundance, PD-L1 expression, predicted
immunocompromised microenvironment, and prominently progressive progression (HR =
4.316, P = 0.0028). In conclusion, this study highlights the immunoevasive tumor 
microenvironment characterized by the higher tumor-associated macrophage
infiltration with the presence of immune checkpoint and T-cell exhaustion genes
in patients with BCa at CDIhigh risk who might suffer progression and be more
suitable to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapies.

Cell death is an important facet of animal development. In some developing
tissues, death is the ultimate fate of over 80% of generated cells. Although
recent studies have delineated a bewildering number of cell death mechanisms,
most have only been observed in pathological contexts, and only a small number
drive normal development. This Primer outlines the important roles, different
types and molecular players regulating developmental cell death, and discusses
recent findings with which the field currently grapples. We also clarify
terminology, to distinguish between developmental cell death mechanisms, for
which there is evidence for evolutionary selection, and cell death that follows
genetic, chemical or physical injury. Finally, we suggest how advances in
understanding developmental cell death may provide insights into the molecular
basis of developmental abnormalities and pathological cell death in disease.

Nucleotide-binding (NB) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) provide
resistance against several plant pathogens. We previously cloned the wheat
powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21, which encodes a coiled-coil (CC) NLR that
confers broad-spectrum resistance against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. Here,
we report comprehensive biochemical and functional analyses of Pm21 CC domain in 
Nicotiana benthamiana. Transient overexpression assay suggested that only the
extended CC (eCC, amino acid residues 1-159) domain has cell-death-inducing
activity, whereas the CC-containing truncations, including CC-NB and CC-NB-LRR,
do not induce cell-death responses. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay showed
that the eCC domain self-associates and interacts with the NB and LRR domains in 
planta. These results imply that the activity of the eCC domain is inhibited by
the intramolecular interactions of different domains in the absence of pathogens.
We found that the LRR domain plays a crucial role in D491V-mediated full-length
(FL) Pm21 autoactivation. Some mutations in the CC domain leading to the loss of 
Pm21 resistance to powdery mildew impaired the CC activity of cell-death
induction. Two mutations (R73Q and E80K) interfered with D491V-mediated Pm21
autoactivation without affecting the cell-death-inducing activity of the eCC
domain. Notably, some susceptible mutants harbouring mutations in the CC domain
still exhibited cell-death-inducing activity. Taken together, these results
implicate the CC domain of Pm21 in cell-death signalling and disease-resistance
signalling, which are potentially independent of each other.

Both plants and animals are endowed with sophisticated innate immune systems to
combat microbial attack. In these multicellular eukaryotes, innate immunity
implies the presence of cell surface receptors and intracellular receptors able
to detect danger signal referred as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) 
and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Membrane-associated pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin
receptors (CLRs), receptor-like kinases (RLKs), and receptor-like proteins (RLPs)
are employed by these organisms for sensing different invasion patterns before
triggering antimicrobial defenses that can be associated with a form of regulated
cell death. Intracellularly, animals nucleotide-binding and oligomerization
domain (NOD)-like receptors or plants nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)-containing 
leucine rich repeats (NLRs) immune receptors likely detect effectors injected
into the host cell by the pathogen to hijack the immune signaling cascade.
Interestingly, during the co-evolution between the hosts and their invaders, key 
cross-kingdom cell death-signaling macromolecular NLR-complexes have been
selected, such as the inflammasome in mammals and the recently discovered
resistosome in plants. In both cases, a regulated cell death located at the site 
of infection constitutes a very effective mean for blocking the pathogen spread
and protecting the whole organism from invasion. This review aims to describe the
immune mechanisms in animals and plants, mainly focusing on cell death signaling 
pathways, in order to highlight recent advances that could be used on one side or
the other to identify the missing signaling elements between the perception of
the invasion pattern by immune receptors, the induction of defenses or the
transmission of danger signals to other cells. Although knowledge of plant
immunity is less advanced, these organisms have certain advantages allowing
easier identification of signaling events, regulators and executors of cell
death, which could then be exploited directly for crop protection purposes or by 
analogy for medical research.

Salicylic acid (SA) is well known hormonal molecule involved in cell death
regulation. In response to a broad range of environmental factors (e.g., high
light, UV, pathogens attack), plants accumulate SA, which participates in cell
death induction and spread in some foliar cells. LESION SIMULATING DISEASE 1
(LSD1) is one of the best-known cell death regulators in Arabidopsis thaliana.
The lsd1 mutant, lacking functional LSD1 protein, accumulates SA and is
conditionally susceptible to many biotic and abiotic stresses. In order to get
more insight into the role of LSD1-dependent regulation of SA accumulation during
cell death, we crossed the lsd1 with the sid2 mutant, caring mutation in
ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1(ICS1) gene and having deregulated SA synthesis, and with
plants expressing the bacterial nahG gene and thus decomposing SA to catechol. In
response to UV A+B irradiation, the lsd1 mutant exhibited clear cell death
phenotype, which was reversed in lsd1/sid2 and lsd1/NahG plants. The expression
of PR-genes and the H2O2 content in UV-treated lsd1 were significantly higher
when compared with the wild type. In contrast, lsd1/sid2 and lsd1/NahG plants
demonstrated comparability with the wild-type level of PR-genes expression and
H2O2. Our results demonstrate that SA accumulation is crucial for triggering cell
death in lsd1, while the reduction of excessive SA accumulation may lead to a
greater tolerance toward abiotic stress.

Chemotherapy constitutes a major part of modern-day therapy for infectious and
chronic diseases. A drug is said to be effective if it can inhibit its target,
induce stress, and thereby trigger an array of cell death pathways in the form of
programmed cell death, autophagy, necrosis, etc. Chemotherapy is the only
treatment choice against trypanosomatid diseases like Leishmaniasis, Chagas
disease, and sleeping sickness. Anti-trypanosomatid drugs can induce various cell
death phenotypes depending upon the drug dose and growth stage of the parasites. 
The mechanisms and pathways triggering cell death in Trypanosomatids serve to
help identify potential targets for the development of effective
anti-trypanosomatids. Studies show that the key proteins involved in cell death
of trypanosomatids are metacaspases, Endonuclease G, Apoptosis-Inducing Factor,
cysteine proteases, serine proteases, antioxidant systems, etc. Unlike higher
eukaryotes, these organisms either lack the complete set of effectors involved in
cell death pathways, or are yet to be deciphered. A detailed summary of the
existing knowledge of different drug-induced cell death pathways would help
identify the lacuna in each of these pathways and therefore open new avenues for 
research and thereby new therapeutic targets to explore. The cell death pathway
associated complexities in metazoans are absent in trypanosomatids; hence this
summary can also help understand the trigger points as well as cross-talk between
these pathways. Here we provide an in-depth overview of the existing knowledge of
these drug-induced trypanosomatid cell death pathways, describe their associated 
physiological changes, and suggest potential interconnections amongst them.

Our aim is to critically review current knowledge of the function and regulation 
of cell death in the developing limb. We provide a detailed, but short, overview 
of the areas of cell death observed in the developing limb, establishing their
function in morphogenesis and structural development of limb tissues. We will
examine the functions of this process in the formation and growth of the limb
primordia, formation of cartilaginous skeleton, formation of synovial joints, and
establishment of muscle bellies, tendons, and entheses. We will analyze the
plasticity of the cell death program by focusing on the developmental potential
of progenitors prior to death. Considering the prolonged plasticity of
progenitors to escape from the death process, we will discuss a new biological
perspective that explains cell death: this process, rather than secondary to a
specific genetic program, is a consequence of the tissue building strategy
employed by the embryo based on the formation of scaffolds that disintegrate once
their associated neighboring structures differentiate.

Inhibitory interneurons integrate into developing circuits in specific ratios and
distributions. In the neocortex, inhibitory network formation occurs concurrently
with the apoptotic elimination of a third of GABAergic interneurons. The cell
surface molecules that select interneurons to survive or die are unknown. Here,
we report that members of the clustered Protocadherins (cPCDHs) control GABAergic
interneuron survival during developmentally-regulated cell death. Conditional
deletion of the gene cluster encoding the γ-Protocadherins (Pcdhgs) from
developing GABAergic neurons in mice of either sex causes a severe loss of
inhibitory populations in multiple brain regions and results in neurologic
deficits such as seizures. By focusing on the neocortex and the cerebellar
cortex, we demonstrate that reductions of inhibitory interneurons result from
elevated apoptosis during the critical postnatal period of programmed cell death 
(PCD). By contrast, cortical interneuron (cIN) populations are not affected by
removal of Pcdhgs from pyramidal neurons or glial cells. Interneuron loss
correlates with reduced AKT signaling in Pcdhg mutant interneurons, and is
rescued by genetic blockade of the pro-apoptotic factor BAX. Together, these
findings identify the PCDHGs as pro-survival transmembrane proteins that select
inhibitory interneurons for survival and modulate the extent of PCD. We propose
that the PCDHGs contribute to the formation of balanced inhibitory networks by
controlling the size of GABAergic interneuron populations in the developing
brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A pivotal step for establishing appropriate
excitatory-inhibitory ratios is adjustment of neuronal populations by cell death.
In the mouse neocortex, a third of GABAergic interneurons are eliminated by
BAX-dependent apoptosis during the first postnatal week. Interneuron cell death
is modulated by neural activity and pro-survival pathways but the cell-surface
molecules that select interneurons for survival or death are unknown. We
demonstrate that members of the cadherin superfamily, the clustered
γ-Protocadherins (PCDHGs), regulate the survival of inhibitory interneurons and
the balance of cell death. Deletion of the Pcdhgs in mice causes inhibitory
interneuron loss in the cortex and cerebellum, and leads to motor deficits and
seizures. Our findings provide a molecular basis for controlling inhibitory
interneuron population size during circuit formation.

Cell death is a vital event in life. Infections and injuries cause lytic cell
death, which gives rise to danger signals that can further induce cell death,
inflammation, and tissue damage. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is an essential,
highly conserved and dynamic metabolic pathway. Here, we discover that farnesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP), a metabolic intermediate of the MVA pathway, functions as a 
newly identified danger signal to trigger acute cell death leading to neuron loss
in stroke. Harboring both a hydrophobic 15-carbon isoprenyl chain and a heavily
charged pyrophosphate head, FPP leads to acute cell death independent of its
downstream metabolic pathways. Mechanistically, extracellular calcium influx and 
the cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) exhibit
essential roles in FPP-induced cell death. FPP activates TRPM2 opening for ion
influx. Furthermore, in terms of a mouse model constructing by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO), FPP accumulates in the brain, which indicates the
function of the FPP and TRPM2 danger signal axis in ischemic injury. Overall, our
data have revealed a novel function of the MVA pathway intermediate metabolite
FPP as a danger signal via transient receptor potential cation channels.

Cell death, be it of neurons or glial cells, marks the development of the nervous
system. Albeit relatively less so than in tissues such as the gut, cell death is 
also a feature of nervous system homeostasis-especially in context of adult
neurogenesis. Finally, cell death is commonplace in acute brain injuries, chronic
neurodegenerative diseases, and in some central nervous system tumors such as
glioblastoma. Recent studies are enumerating the various molecular modalities
involved in the execution of cells. Intimately linked with cell death are
mechanisms of disposal that remove the dead cell and bring about a tissue-level
response. Heretofore, the association between these methods of dying and
physiological or pathological responses has remained nebulous. It is envisioned
that careful cartography of death and disposal may reveal novel understandings of
disease states and chart new therapeutic strategies in the near future.

Calcium is an essential element for plants' survival and ability to deal with
environmental stresses. However, it can cause cell death due to cellular
disequilibrium. Serpentine plants are sensitive to high concentrations of Ca2+,
which induces lethal symptoms, especially under environmental stress. In this
study, the direct effects of Ca2+ on cell death were investigated in cell
cultures of Alyssum inflatum, a serpentine plant native to Western Iran, and
results were compared to a non-serpentinitic congeneric species A. saxatile. The 
results were also compared to the effects of Mg2+ treatments in both species, as 
another determinative factor in serpentinite soil is high Mg2+ content. Plasma
membrane permeability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA)
production were measured as physiological cell injury indices. In A. inflatum
higher levels of ROS and MDA were observed in Ca2+-treated cells (5 mM or more), 
while in A. saxatile they were measured in Mg2+-treated cells (5 mM or more). In 
serpentine species, results indicated that cell death by Ca2+ was more intensive 
than the cell death by Mg2+, which were observed with less intensity in
non-serpentine plants. Microscopic studies showed that cell death occurred via
apoptosis-like programmed cell death (AL-PCD). Therefore, Ca2+ sensitivity and
AL-PCD as mechanistic reasons for their non-serpentine intolerance would be a
crucial consideration in cellular researches concerning serpentine plants, which 
could be employed in green technologies such as phytoremediation.

Pancreatic cancer is a devastating gastrointestinal cancer characterized by late 
diagnosis, limited treatment success and dismal prognosis. Exocrine tumours
account for 95% of pancreatic cancers and the most common pathological type is
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The occurrence and progression of PDAC
involve multiple factors, including internal genetic alterations and external
inflammatory stimuli. The biology and therapeutic response of PDAC are further
shaped by various forms of regulated cell death, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, 
ferroptosis, pyroptosis and alkaliptosis. Cell death induced by local or systemic
treatments suppresses tumour proliferation, invasion and metastasis. However,
unrestricted cell death or tissue damage might result in an inflammation-related 
immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is conducive to tumour progression or
recurrence. The precise extent to which cell death affects PDAC is not yet well
described. A growing body of preclinical and clinical studies document
significant correlations between mutations (for example, in KRAS and TP53),
stress responses (such as hypoxia and autophagy), metabolic reprogramming and
chemotherapeutic responses. Here, we describe the molecular machinery of cell
death, discuss the complexity and multifaceted nature of lethal signalling in
PDAC cells, and highlight the challenges and opportunities for activating cell
death pathways through precision oncology treatments.

Cellular response to insults may result in the initiation of different cell death
processes. For many cases the cell death process will result in an acute release 
of cellular material that in some circumstances provides valuable information
about the process (i.e. may represent a biomarker). The characteristics of the
biomarker release is often informative and plays critical roles in clinical
practice and toxicology research. The aim of this study is to develop a general, 
semi-mechanistic model to describe cell turnover and biomarker release by injured
tissue that can be used for estimation in pharmacokinetic and
(toxicokinetic)-pharmacodynamic studies. The model included three components: (1)
natural tissue turnover, (2) biomarker release from cell death and its movement
from the cell through the tissue into the blood, (3) different target insult
mechanisms of cell death. We applied the general model to biomarker release
profiles for four different cell insult causes. Our model simulations showed good
agreements with reported data under both delayed release and rapid release cases.
Additionally, we illustrate the use of the model to provide different biomarker
profiles. We also provided details on interpreting parameters and their values
for other researchers to customize its use. In conclusion, our general model
provides a basic structure to study the kinetic behaviour of biomarker release
and disposition after cellular insult.

Sepsis remains to be a major contributor to mortality in ICUs, and immune
suppression caused by immune cell apoptosis determines the overall patient
survival. However, diagnosis of sepsis-induced lymphopenia remains problematic
with no accurate prognostic techniques or biomarkers for cell death available.
Developing reliable prognostic tools for sepsis-mediated cell death is not only
important for identifying patients at increased risk of immune suppression but
also to monitor treatment progress of currently trialed immunotherapy strategies.
We have previously shown an important role for endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER
stress) in inducing sepsis-mediated cell death and here report on the
identification of a secreted form of the ER chaperone BiP (immunoglobulin binding
protein) as a novel circulating prognostic biomarker for immune cell death and ER
stress during sepsis. Using biochemical purification and mass spectrometry
coupled with an established in vitro sepsis cell death assay, we identified
BiP/Grp78 as a factor secreted by lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages that
is capable of inducing cell death in target cells. Quantitative ELISA analysis
showed significantly elevated levels of circulating BiP in mice undergoing
polymicrobial sepsis, which was absent in Bim-/- mice that are protected from
sepsis-induced lymphopenia. Using blood serum from human sepsis patients, we
could detect a significant difference in levels of secreted BiP in sepsis
patients compared to nonseptic controls, suggesting that secreted circulating BiP
could indeed be used as a prognostic marker that is directly correlative to
immune cell death during sepsis.

Regulated cell death is a widely attractive subject among the topics of cancer
therapy and has gained some advances for discovery of targeted anticancer drugs. 
In the past decade, nonapoptotic regulated cell death has been implicated in the 
development and therapeutic responses of a variety of human cancers. Hitherto,
targeting autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD), ferroptosis, and necroptosis
with small molecules has been emerging as a hopeful strategy for the improvement 
of potential cancer therapy, which may have an advantage to bypass the
apoptosis-resistance machinery. Thus, in this perspective, we concentrate on the 
key molecular insights into ADCD, ferroptosis, and necroptosis and summarize the 
corresponding small molecules in potential cancer therapy. Moreover, the
relationships between the three subroutines and small molecules modulating the
crosstalk are discussed. We believe that these inspiring findings would be
advantageous to exploiting more potential targets and pharmacological small
molecules in future cancer treatment.

Competitive Cell Death Interactions in Pulmonary Infection: Host Modulation
Versus Pathogen Manipulation.

Immunology, Brown University, Providence, RI, United States.

In the context of pulmonary infection, both hosts and pathogens have evolved a
multitude of mechanisms to regulate the process of host cell death. The host aims
to rapidly induce an inflammatory response at the site of infection, promote
pathogen clearance, quickly resolve inflammation, and return to tissue
homeostasis. The appropriate modulation of cell death in respiratory epithelial
cells and pulmonary immune cells is central in the execution of all these
processes. Cell death can be either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending
on regulated cell death (RCD) modality triggered and the infection context. In
addition, diverse bacterial pathogens have evolved many means to manipulate host 
cell death to increase bacterial survival and spread. The multitude of ways that 
hosts and bacteria engage in a molecular tug of war to modulate cell death
dynamics during infection emphasizes its relevance in host responses and pathogen
virulence at the host pathogen interface. This narrative review outlines several 
current lines of research characterizing bacterial pathogen manipulation of host 
cell death pathways in the lung. We postulate that understanding these
interactions and the dynamics of intracellular and extracellular bacteria RCD
manipulation, may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of
intractable respiratory infections.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate secondary cell death after
acute central nervous system (CNS) injury is critical for the development of
effective neuroprotective drugs. Previous research has shown that neurotoxic
processes including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can
cause secondary cell death. Nevertheless, clinical trials targeting these
processes have been largely unsuccessful, suggesting that the signalling pathways
underlying secondary cell death remain incompletely understood. Due to their
suitability for live imaging and their amenability to genetic and pharmacological
manipulation, larval zebrafish provide an ideal platform for studying the
regulation of secondary cell death in vivo Here, we use RNA-seq gene expression
profiling and compound screening to identify signalling pathways that regulate
secondary cell death after acute neural injury in larval zebrafish. RNA-seq
analysis of genes upregulated in cephalic mpeg1+ macrophage-lineage cells
isolated from mpeg1:GFP transgenic larvae after neural injury suggested an
involvement of cytokine and polyamine signalling in secondary cell death.
Furthermore, screening a library of FDA approved compounds indicated roles for
GABA, serotonin and dopamine signalling. Overall, our results highlight multiple 
signalling pathways that regulate secondary cell death in vivo, and thus provide 
a starting point for the development of novel neuroprotective treatments for
patients with CNS injury.This article has an associated First Person interview

In TNF signaling, ubiquitination of RIP1 functions as an early cell-death
checkpoint, which prevents the spatial transition of the signaling complex from
complex-I to death-inducing complex-II. Here, we report that ankyrin repeat
domain 13a (ANKRD13a) acts as a novel component of complex-II to set a higher
signal threshold for the cytotoxic potential of TNF. ANKRD13a deficiency is
sufficient to turn the response to TNF from survival to death by promoting the
formation of complex-II without affecting NF-κB activation. ANKRD13a binds to
ubiquitinated-RIP1 via its UIM, and subsequently limits the association of FADD
and caspase-8 with RIP1. Moreover, high ANKRD13a expression is inversely
correlated with apoptotic phenotypes in ovarian cancer tissues and is associated 
with poor prognosis. Our work identifies ANKRD13a as a novel gatekeeper of the
early cell-death checkpoint, which may function as part of an escape mechanism
from cell death in some cancers.

Air pollution is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and with cell 
death at a cellular level. However, the exact mechanism of particulate
matter-induced cell death remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present in
vitro study using human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) was to determine the
cell death pathway(s) induced by black carbon (BC) and ozone oxidized-black
carbon (O-BC). BC and O-BC induced A549 cell death and the cytotoxic effect was
dose-dependent. Cell death was significantly abrogated by inhibitor of receptor
protein interacting kinase 1 (RIPK1) but only mildly inhibited by apoptosis
inhibitor and RIPK3. BC- and O-BC-treated cells showed RIPK1 and RIPK3 protein
overexpression and high phosphorylated levels of these proteins, as well as
detectable levels of caspase-8 active form. BC- and O-BC-triggered cell death was
also fully rescued in A549 cells that under-expressed RIPK1 with RIPK1 siRNA. Our
results indicated that BC and O-BC could induce cell death through a multitude of
pathways including apoptotic and necroptotic pathways and that RIPK1 is the
upstream signal protein of these cell death pathways, with an important role in
the regulation of BC-induced cell death.

Possible Involvement of DNA Methylation and Protective Effect of Zebularine on
Neuronal Cell Death after Glutamate Excitotoxity.

Asada M(1), Hayashi H(1), Takagi N(1).

Author information:

Sciences.

Neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia consists various steps including
glutamate excitotoxity. Excessive Ca2+ influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor, which is one of the ionotropic glutamate receptors, plays a
central role in neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia. We previously
reported that DNA methylation is transiently increased in neurons during ischemic
injury and that this aberrant DNA methylation is accompanied by neuronal cell
death. Therefore, we performed the present experiments on glutamate
excitotoxicity to gain further insight into DNA methylation involvement in the
neuronal cell death. We demonstrated that knockdown of DNA methyltransferase
(DNMT)1, DNMT3a, or DNMT3b gene in Neuro2a cells was performed to examine which
DNMTs were more important for neuronal cell death after glutamate excitotoxicity.
Although we confirmed a decrease in the levels of the target DNMT protein after
small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, the Neuro2a cells were not protected 
from injury by transfection with siRNA for each DNMT. We next revealed that the
pharmacological inhibitor of DNMTs protected against glutamate excitotoxicity in 
Neuro2a cells and also in primary cultured cortical neurons. This protective
effect was associated with a decrease in the number of 5-methylcytosine
(5 mC)-positive cells under glutamate excitotoxicity. In addition, the increased 
level of cleaved caspase-3 was also reduced by a DNMT inhibitor. Our results
suggest the possibility that at least 2 or all DNMTs functionally would cooperate
to activate DNA methylation after glutamate excitotoxicity and that inhibition of
DNA methylation in neurons after cerebral ischemia might become a strategy to
reduce the neuronal injury.

Increasing evidence suggests that induction of lethal macroautophagy/autophagy
carries potential significance for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). In
continuation of previous work, we demonstrate that pimozide and loperamide
trigger an ATG5- and ATG7 (autophagy related 5 and 7)-dependent type of cell
death that is significantly reduced with cathepsin inhibitors and the lipid
reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger α-tocopherol in MZ-54 GBM cells. Global
proteomic analysis after treatment with both drugs also revealed an increase of
proteins related to lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes. These changes were
accompanied by a massive accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the
lysosomal compartment, indicative of impaired lipid transport/degradation. In
line with these observations, pimozide and loperamide treatment were associated
with a pronounced increase of bioactive sphingolipids including ceramides,
glucosylceramides and sphingoid bases measured by targeted lipidomic analysis.
Furthermore, pimozide and loperamide inhibited the activity of SMPD1/ASM
(sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1) and promoted induction of lysosomal membrane 
permeabilization (LMP), as well as release of CTSB (cathepsin B) into the cytosol
in MZ-54 wild-type (WT) cells. Whereas LMP and cell death were significantly
attenuated in ATG5 and ATG7 knockout (KO) cells, both events were enhanced by
depletion of the lysophagy receptor VCP (valosin containing protein), supporting 
a pro-survival function of lysophagy under these conditions. Collectively, our
data suggest that pimozide and loperamide-driven autophagy and lipotoxicity
synergize to induce LMP and cell death. The results also support the notion that 
simultaneous overactivation of autophagy and induction of LMP represents a
promising approach for the treatment of GBM.Abbreviations: ACD: autophagic cell

Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of retinal disorders that cause 
progressive and severe loss of vision because of retinal cell death, mainly
photoreceptor cells. IRDs include retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common IRD.
IRDs present a genetic and clinical heterogeneity that makes it difficult to
achieve proper treatment. The progression of IRDs is influenced, among other
factors, by the activation of the immune cells (microglia, macrophages, etc.) and
the release of inflammatory molecules such as chemokines and cytokines.
Upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, 
is found in IRDs. This cytokine may influence photoreceptor cell death. Different
cell death mechanisms are proposed, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis,
autophagy, excessive activation of calpains, or parthanatos for photoreceptor
cell death. Some of these cell death mechanisms are linked to TNFα upregulation
and inflammation. Therapeutic approaches that reduce retinal inflammation have
emerged as useful therapies for slowing down the progression of IRDs. We focused 
this review on the relationship between retinal inflammation and the different
cell death mechanisms involved in RP. We also reviewed the main anti-inflammatory
therapies for the treatment of IRDs.

Plants are vulnerable to heat stress, especially during reproductive development.
The heat shock response (HSR) in the cytosol and nucleus, as well as the unfolded
protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), are two mechanisms that
enable plants to survive heat stress. Excessive heat or ER stresses lead to cell 
death when the UPR cannot repair stress damage, but the means by which cell
survival or death is determined remains unclear. In this study, we used a
genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify that a cluster of five
Immune-associated nucleotide-binding protein (IAN) genes (IAN2 to IAN6) is
responsible for variation in heat tolerance at the reproductive stage in
Arabidopsis thaliana. These IAN genes have both unique and overlapping functions 
in the negative regulation of heat tolerance, and their loss of function singly
or in combination confers increased heat tolerance, measured by a lower number of
barren siliques and a higher seedling survival rate under heat. The loss of rice 
IAN1 gene function also leads to enhanced heat tolerance, suggesting a conserved 
function of plant IANs. Transcriptome analysis revealed enhanced expression of
HSR and UPR genes, as well as reduced cell death, under heat and ER stress in the
mutant of IAN6, a major effect member in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the IAN
proteins were found to promote cell death induced by heat stress, ER stress, and 
cell death-inducing molecules. Thus, the Arabidopsis IAN genes repress heat
tolerance, probably through the HSR and UPR and by enhancing the cell death
pathway. The IAN2 to IAN6 proteins are partially localized to the ER, suggesting 
a direct role in the UPR and UPR-mediated cell death. In addition, a natural IAN6
variant from more heat-tolerant Arabidopsis accessions confers greater heat
tolerance and induces less cell death compared with the natural variant from less
heat-tolerant accessions. The heat-tolerant IAN6 variant is associated with a
higher maximum temperature of the warmest month at its collection sites compared 
with the heat-sensitive variant. Taken together, these results reveal an
important role of Arabidopsis IAN2 to IAN6 genes in the regulation of the HSR,
UPR, and cell death, and suggest that their natural variations have adaptive
functions in heat tolerance.

Intrinsic apoptosis as a modality of regulated cell death is intimately linked to
permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of
the protein cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it can participate in caspase
activation via apoptosome formation. Interestingly, cytochrome c release is an
ancient feature of regulated cell death even in unicellular eukaryotes that do
not contain an apoptosome. Therefore, it was speculated that cytochrome c release
might have an additional, more fundamental role for cell death signalling,
because its absence from mitochondria disrupts oxidative phosphorylation. Here,
we permanently anchored cytochrome c with a transmembrane segment to the inner
mitochondrial membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, thereby inhibiting 
its release from mitochondria during regulated cell death. This cytochrome c
retains respiratory growth and correct assembly of mitochondrial respiratory
chain supercomplexes. However, membrane anchoring leads to a sensitisation to
acetic acid-induced cell death and increased oxidative stress, a compensatory
elevation of cellular oxygen-consumption in aged cells and a decreased
chronological lifespan. We therefore conclude that loss of cytochrome c from
mitochondria during regulated cell death and the subsequent disruption of
oxidative phosphorylation is not required for efficient execution of cell death
in yeast, and that mobility of cytochrome c within the mitochondrial
intermembrane space confers a fitness advantage that overcomes a potential role
in regulated cell death signalling in the absence of an apoptosome.

KEY MESSAGE: Fumonisin B1 induces rapid programmed cell death in Arabidopsis
cells, oxidative and nitrosative bursts, and differentially modulates cell death 
responsive genes. Glutathione is the main antioxidant involved in the stress
response. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a fungal toxin produced by Fusarium spp. able to 
exert pleiotropic toxicity in plants. FB1 is known to be a strong inducer of the 
programmed cell death (PCD); however, the exact mechanism underling the
plant-toxin interactions and the molecular events that lead to PCD are still
unclear. Therefore, in this work, we provided a comprehensive investigation of
the response of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana at the nuclear,
transcriptional, and biochemical level after the treatment with FB1 at two
different concentrations, namely 1 and 5 µM during a time-course of 96 h. FB1
induced oxidative and nitrosative bursts and a rapid cell death in Arabidopsis
cell cultures, which resembled a HR-like PCD event. Different genes involved in
the regulation of PCD, antioxidant metabolism, photosynthesis, pathogenesis, and 
sugar transport were upregulated, especially during the late treatment time and
with higher FB1 concentration. Among the antioxidant enzymes and compounds
studied, only glutathione appeared to be highly induced in both treatments,
suggesting that it might be an important stress molecule induced during FB1
exposure. Collectively, these findings highlight the complexity of the signaling 
network of A. thaliana and provide information for the understanding of the
physiological, molecular, and biochemical responses to counteract FB1-induced
toxicity.

Sphingolipids are structural components of the lipid bilayer that acts as
signaling molecules in many cellular processes, including cell death. Ceramides, 
key intermediates in sphingolipid metabolism, are phosphorylated by the ceramide 
kinase ACCELERATED CELL DEATH5 (ACD5). The loss of ACD5 function leads to
ceramide accumulation and spontaneous cell death. Here, we report that the
jasmonate (JA) pathway is activated in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
acd5 mutant and that methyl JA treatment accelerates ceramide accumulation and
cell death in acd5. Moreover, the double mutants of acd5 with jasmonate
resistant1-1 and coronatine insensitive1-2 exhibited delayed cell death,
suggesting that the JA pathway is involved in acd5-mediated cell death.
Quantitative sphingolipid profiling of plants treated with methyl JA indicated
that JAs influence sphingolipid metabolism by increasing the levels of ceramides 
and hydroxyceramides, but this pathway is dramatically attenuated by mutations
affecting JA pathway proteins. Furthermore, we showed that JAs regulate the
expression of genes encoding enzymes in ceramide metabolism. Together, our
findings show that JAs accelerate cell death in acd5 mutants, possibly by
modulating sphingolipid metabolism and increasing ceramide levels.

Cell death is a natural process in organismal development, homeostasis and
response to disease or infection that eliminates unnecessary or potentially
dangerous cells and acts as an innate barrier to oncogenesis. Inactivation of
cell death is a key step in tumour development and also impedes effective
response to cancer therapy. Precise execution of unwanted cells is achieved
through regulated cell death processes including the intrinsic apoptotic pathway 
that is governed by the BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family. There is
compelling evidence that intrinsic apoptosis is defective in prostate cancer,
particularly in metastatic and castration resistant advanced disease, currently a
lethal diagnosis. New therapeutics have been developed to target pro-survival
BCL-2 proteins (including BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1) and show promise in
reinstating apoptosis to destroy tumour cells in haematological cancers. Here we 
discuss perturbation of cell death in prostate cancer and how new therapeutics
could improve treatment outcome in prostate cancer.

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is a DNA damage sensor that gets activated
in proportion to the damage, helping cells to determine whether to repair the
damage or initiate cell death processes. We have previously shown PARP1's
significance in the developmental processes of Dictyostelium discoideum in
addition to its role in oxidative stress and UV-C stress induced cell death. In
this study, we show the significance of ROS in PARP1 mediated responses of D.
discoideum under different stress conditions. Interestingly, our results suggest 
differential kinetics of PARP1 activation and implications of ROS in starvation
and cadmium induced cell death events. Increased accumulation of Poly
(ADP-ribose), a product of PARP activation, could be detected within minutes post
cadmium stress, whereas PARP1 activation was only a later event with starvation. 
Starvation induced PARP1 activation was supported by the depletion of ATP and
NAD+, while PARP inhibitor confers protective effect during starvation. During
starvation, cell death is induced in two phases, a primary ROS driven PARP1
independent early necrotic phase followed by a PARP1 driven ROS dependent
paraptotic phase; both of which comprise mitochondrial changes. Cadmium (Cd)
exerted a dose-dependent effect on cell death; a low dose of 0.2 mM Cd led to
paraptosis and a higher dose of 0.5 mM Cd led to necrosis in D. discoideum cells 
within 24 h. Interestingly, glutathione (GSH) exposure could rescue cells from Cd
stress mediated cell death. Besides unicellular cell death, the developmental
arrest induced by cadmium and oxidative stress could be rescued by reinstating
the redox equilibrium using GSH. In conclusion, we underscore the significant
link between PARP1 and ROS in regulating the process of cell death and
development in D. discoideum.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) is a highly
selective and promising anticancer agent due to its specific apoptosis-inducing
effect on tumor cells, rather than most normal cells. TRAIL is currently under
investigation for use in the treatment of leukemia. However, the resistance of
leukemic cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis may limit its efficacy. The mechanisms 
of leukemic cell resistance to antitumor immunity remains a topical issue. In
this work, we have found an increase in the resistance to TRAIL-induced cell
death in human leukemia THP-1 cells, which was caused by differentiation into a
macrophage-like phenotype in high-density culture in vitro. Stressful conditions,
manifested by the inhibition of cell growth and the activation of cell death in
high-density culture of THP-1 cells, induced the appearance of cells adhered to
culture dishes. The THP-1ad cell line was derived by selection of these adhered
cells. The genetic study, using STR and aCGH assays, has shown that THP-1ad cells
were derived from THP-1 cells due to mutagenesis. The THP-1ad cells possessed
high proliferative potential and a macrophage-like immunophenotype. The adhesion 
of THP-1ad cells to the extracellular matrix was mediated by αVβ5 integrin. The
cytokine production, as well as the rise of intracellular ROS and NO activities
by LPS in THP-1ad cell culture, were characteristic of macrophage-like cells. The
THP-1ad cells were found to appear to increase in resistance to TRAIL-induced
cell death in comparison with THP-1 cells. The mechanism of the increase in
TRAIL-resistance can be related to a decrease in the expression of death
receptors DR4 and DR5 on the THP-1ad cells. Thus, the macrophage-like phenotype
formation with the maintenance of a high proliferative potential of leukemic
cells, caused by stress conditions in high-density cell cultures in vitro, can
induce an increase in resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death due to the loss of
DR4 and DR5 receptors. The possible realization of these events in vivo may be
the reason for tumor progression.

Duloxetine is a clinical drug that is primarily used for treatment of depression 
and pain, but it has side effects of addiction and tolerance. Cytochrome P450
(CYP) is its metabolic enzyme, and the drug's biofunction results from its
neuro-protective effect in animal and cell models. We aimed to investigate the
duloxetine-induced neural cytotoxicity effect and its performance in an N2a cell 
neurite outgrowth model. Cell death was assessed as cell viability using a Cell
Count Kit-8 and further evaluated using bright-field images, propidium iodide
(PI) and annexin V staining, colony-formation analysis, TUNEL staining of the
cells, and biochemical testing. N2a cells were committed to differentiation by
serum withdrawal and RA induction, and the neurite outgrowth was evaluated as the
number of differentiated cells, longest neurite length, and average neurite
length. Cell cycle analysis, PI and annexin V staining, mRNA expression, and
biochemical testing were used to evaluate the drug effects on differentiation.
The induction of neural cell death by duloxetine was not affected by classic cell
death inhibitors but was promoted by the CYP inducer rifampicin. N2a cell neurite
outgrowth was promoted by duloxetine via reduction of the CYP2D6 and MDA levels
and induction of Bdnf protein levels. Duloxetine induces neural cell death
through effects on CYP and promotes N2a cell neurite outgrowth by regulating CYP,
Bdnf protein, and the intracellular lipid peroxidation level.

Cyanobacteria are a large group of ubiquitously found photosynthetic prokaryotes 
that are constantly exposed to different kinds of stressors of varying
intensities and seem to overcome these in a precise and regulated manner.
However, a high dose and duration of given stress induce cell death in a few
select cyanobacteria, mainly to protect other cells (altruism). Despite the
recent findings for the presence of biochemical and molecular hallmarks of cell
death in cyanobacteria, it is yet a sketchily understood phenomenon. Regulation
of metacaspase-like genes during Programmed Cell Death suggests it to be a
genetically controlled mechanism like other eukaryotes. In addition to providing 
a comprehensive understanding of the current status of cell death in
cyanobacteria, this review has used in silico analyses to directly compare the
existence of some important molecular players operating in the intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Phylogenetic trees for all sequences indicate a
cluster with a common ancestry and also a divergence from sequences of eukaryotic
origin. To the best of our knowledge, such a comparison (except for
orthocaspases) has not been attempted earlier and hopes to encourage workers in
the field to investigate this altruistic phenomenon in detail.

Apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2, also known as PDCD6) is a member of the
penta-EF-hand (PEF) family of Ca2+-binding proteins. The murine gene encoding
ALG-2 was originally reported to be an essential gene for apoptosis. However, the
role of ALG-2 in cell death pathways has remained elusive. In the present study, 
we found that cell death-inducing p53 target protein 1 (CDIP1), a pro-apoptotic
protein, interacts with ALG-2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation 
analysis of GFP-fused CDIP1 (GFP-CDIP1) revealed that GFP-CDIP1 associates with
tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), a known target of ALG-2 and a subunit of 
endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I). ESCRT-I is a
heterotetrameric complex composed of TSG101, VPS28, VPS37 and MVB12/UBAP1. Of
diverse ESCRT-I species originating from four VPS37 isoforms (A, B, C, and D),
CDIP1 preferentially associates with ESCRT-I containing VPS37B or VPS37C in part 
through the adaptor function of ALG-2. Overexpression of GFP-CDIP1 in HEK293
cells caused caspase-3/7-mediated cell death. In addition, the cell death was
enhanced by co-expression of ALG-2 and ESCRT-I, indicating that ALG-2 likely
promotes CDIP1-induced cell death by promoting the association between CDIP1 and 
ESCRT-I. We also found that CDIP1 binds to vesicle-associated membrane
protein-associated protein (VAP)A and VAPB through the two phenylalanines in an
acidic tract (FFAT)-like motif in the C-terminal region of CDIP1, mutations of
which resulted in reduction of CDIP1-induced cell death. Therefore, our findings 
suggest that different expression levels of ALG-2, ESCRT-I subunits, VAPA and
VAPB may have an impact on sensitivity of anticancer drugs associated with CDIP1 
expression.

A viral infection that involves virus invasion, protein synthesis, and virion
assembly is typically accompanied by sharp fluctuations in the intracellular
levels of metabolites. Under certain conditions, dramatic metabolic shifts can
result in various types of cell death. Here, we review different types of
adenovirus-induced cell death associated with changes in metabolic profiles of
the infected cells. As evidenced by experimental data, in most cases changes in
the metabolome precede cell death rather than represent its consequence. In our
previous study, the induction of autophagic cell death was observed following
adenovirus-mediated lactate production, acetyl-CoA accumulation, and ATP release,
while apoptosis was demonstrated to be modulated by alterations in acetate and
asparagine metabolism. On the other hand, adenovirus-induced ROS production and
ATP depletion were demonstrated to play a significant role in the process of
necrotic cell death. Interestingly, the accumulation of ceramide compounds was
found to contribute to the induction of all the three types of cell death
mentioned above. Eventually, the characterization of metabolite analysis could
help in uncovering the molecular mechanism of adenovirus-mediated cell death
induction and contribute to the development of efficacious oncolytic adenoviral
vectors.

Tumor cell apoptosis evasion is one of the main reasons for easy metastasis
occurrence, chemotherapy resistance, and the low five-year survival rate of
digestive system tumors. Current research has shown that non-apoptotic cell death
plays an important role in tumors of the digestive system. Therefore, increasing 
the proportion of non-apoptotic tumor cells is one of the effective methods of
improving therapeutic efficacies for digestive system tumors. Non-apoptotic cell 
death modes mainly include autophagic cell death, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, in
addition to other cell death modes. This review covers a systematic review
relating to the research progress made into autophagic cell death, pyroptosis,
ferroptosis, and other cell death modes in the treatment of digestive system
tumors. It also highlights how treatment is a reasonable prospect based on
clinical experience and provides reliable guidance for the further development of
digestive system tumor treatments.

Several mechanisms underline induction of CD4 T-cell death by human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. For a long time, apoptosis was considered
central to cell death involved in the depletion of CD4 T cells during HIV
infection. However, which types of cell death are induced during the early phase 
of HIV infection in vivo remains unclear. In this study, CD4 T-cell death induced
in early HIV infection was characterized using humanized mice challenged with
CCR5-tropic (R5) or CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1. Results showed that CD4 T-cell death
was induced in the spleen 3 days post-challenge with both R5 and X4 HIV-1.
Although cell death without caspase-1 and caspase-3/7 activation was
preferentially observed, caspase-1+ pyroptosis was also significantly induced
within the memory subpopulation by R5 or X4 HIV-1 and the naïve subpopulation by 
X4 HIV-1. In contrast, caspase-3/7+ apoptosis was not enhanced by either R5 or X4
HIV-1. Furthermore, phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein+
necroptosis was induced by only X4 HIV-1. These findings indicate that various
types of non-apoptotic CD4 T-cell death, such as pyroptosis and necroptosis, are 
induced during the early phase of HIV infection in vivo.

The adult heart is a post-mitotic terminally differentiated organ; therefore,
beyond development, cardiomyocyte cell death is maladaptive. Heart disease is the
leading cause of death in the world and aberrant cardiomyocyte cell death is the 
underlying problem for most cardiovascular-related diseases and fatalities. In
this chapter, we will discuss the different cell death mechanisms that engage
during normal cardiac development, aging, and disease states. The most abundant
loss of cardiomyocytes occurs during a myocardial infarction, when the blood
supply to the heart is obstructed, and the affected myocardium succumbs to cell
death. Originally, this form of cell death was considered to be unregulated;
however, research from the last half a century clearly demonstrates that this
form of cell death is multifaceted and employees various degrees of regulation.
We will explore all of the cell death pathways that have been implicated in this 
disease state and the potential interplay between them. Beyond myocardial
infarction, we also explore the role and mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell death
in heart failure, myocarditis, and chemotherapeutic-induced cardiotoxicity.
Inhibition of cardiomyocyte cell death has extensive therapeutic potential that
will increase the longevity and health of the human heart.

Inflammatory macrophages have been implicated in many diseases, including
rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, targeting
macrophage function and activation may represent a potential strategy to treat
macrophage-associated diseases. We have previously shown that IFN-γ-induced
differentiation of human M0 macrophages toward proinflammatory M1 state rendered 
them highly susceptible to the cytocidal effects of second mitochondria-derived
activator of caspases mimetics (SMs), antagonist of the inhibitors of apoptosis
proteins (IAPs), whereas M0 and anti-inflammatory M2c macrophages were resistant.
In this study, we investigated the mechanism governing SM-induced cell death
during differentiation into M1 macrophages and in polarized M1 macrophages. IFN-γ
stimulation conferred on M0 macrophages the sensitivity to SM-induced cell death 
through the Jak/STAT, IFN regulatory factor-1, and mammalian target of rapamycin 
complex-1 (mTORC-1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase pathways. Interestingly, mTORC-1 
regulated SM-induced cell death independent of M1 differentiation. In contrast,
SM-induced cell death in polarized M1 macrophages is regulated by the mTORC-2
pathway. Moreover, SM-induced cell death is regulated by cellular IAP (cIAP)-2,
receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1, and RIPK-3 degradation through
mTORC activation during differentiation into M1 macrophages and in polarized M1
macrophages. In contrast to cancer cell lines, SM-induced cell death in M1
macrophages is independent of endogenously produced TNF-α, as well as the NF-κB
pathway. Collectively, selective induction of cell death in human M1 macrophages 
by SMs may be mediated by cIAP-2, RIPK-1, and RIPK-3 degradation through mTORC
activation. Moreover, blocking cIAP-1/2, mTORC, or IFN regulatory factor-1 may
represent a promising therapeutic strategy to control M1-associated diseases.

Burn Injury: Mechanisms of Keratinocyte Cell Death.

Cutaneous burn injury is associated with epidermal loss in the zone of
coagulation zone and delayed tissue loss in the zone of stasis. Thus, thermal
stress can trigger both necrosis and regulated cell death (RCD) or apoptosis.
Experimental in vitro and in vivo work has clearly demonstrated apoptotic events 
of thermally injured keratinocytes that are accompanied by morphological and
biochemical markers of regulated cell death. However, in vivo data for the
different pathways of regulated cell death are sparse. In vitro experiments with 
heat-stressed human keratinocytes have demonstrated death receptor involvement
(extrinsic apoptosis), calcium influx, and disruption of mitochondrial membrane
potential (intrinsic apoptosis) in regulated cell death. In addition,
caspase-independent pathways have been suggested in regulated cell death.
Keratinocyte heat stress leads to reduced proliferation, possibly as a result of 
reduced keratinocyte adhesion (anoikis) or oncogene involvement. Understanding
the underlying mechanisms of RCD and the skin's responses to thermal stress may
lead to improved strategies for treating cutaneous burn trauma.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a severe public health threat
world-wide. Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced airway epithelial cell death is a major 
pathway of pathogenesis in emphysema, a subtype of COPD. Protein arginine
methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is a type I PRMT that catalyzes mono- and
di-methylation on arginine residues within histone and non-histone proteins to
modulate a variety of life processes, such as apoptosis. However, its role in
CS-induced lung epithelial death has not been fully elucidated. Here we report
that PRMT6 was decreased in mouse lung tissues from a cigarette smoke extract
(CSE)-mediated experimental emphysematous model and in CSE treated or cigarette
smoke exposed lung epithelial cells. Depletion of PRMT6 increased the protein
levels of phosphatase PTEN and PI3K regulatory subunit p85 but decreased a
downstream kinase PDK1, resulting in AKT dephosphorylation and thereafter, lung
epithelial cell death. Knockout of PRMT6 inhibited epithelial survival and
promoted CSE-mediated epithelial cell death, while ectopic expression of PRMT6
protein partially reversed epithelial cell death via PI3K/AKT-mediated cell
survival signaling in CSE cellular models. These findings demonstrate that PRMT6 
plays a crucial role in CS-induced bronchial epithelial cell death that may be a 
potential therapeutic target against the airway cell death in CS-induced COPD.

Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are the most abundant
type of immune receptors in plants and can trigger a rapid cell-death
(hypersensitive) response upon sensing pathogens. We previously cloned the wheat 
NLR Sr35, which encodes a coiled-coil (CC) NLR that confers resistance to the
virulent wheat stem rust race Ug99. Here, we investigated Sr35 signaling after
Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Expression 
of Sr35 in N. benthamiana leaves triggered a mild cell-death response, which is
enhanced in the autoactive mutant Sr35 D503V. The N-terminal tagging of Sr35 with
green fluorescent protein (GFP) blocked the induction of cell death, whereas a
C-terminal GFP tag did not. No domain truncations of Sr35 generated cell-death
responses as strong as the wild type, but a truncation including the NB-ARC
(nucleotide binding adaptor) shared by APAF-1, R proteins, and CED-4 domains in
combination with the D503V autoactive mutation triggered cell death. In addition,
coexpression of Sr35 with the matching pathogen effector protein AvrSr35 resulted
in robust cell death and electrolyte leakage levels that were similar to
autoactive Sr35 and significantly higher than Sr35 alone. Coexpression of
Sr35-CC-NB-ARC and AvrSr35 did not induce cell death, confirming the importance
of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain for AvrSr35 recognition. These findings
were confirmed through Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in barley.
Taken together, these results implicate the CC-NB-ARC domains of Sr35 in inducing
cell death and the LRR domain in AvrSr35 recognition.[Formula: see text]

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Regulates Different Types of Cell Death by Acting
as a Rheostat.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for cellular signaling and response
to stress. The level of ROS and the type of ROS determine the ability of cells to
undergo cell death. Furthermore, dysregulation of the antioxidant pathways is
associated with many diseases. It has become apparent that cell death can occur
through different mechanisms leading to the classifications of different types of
cell death such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis. ROS play essential
roles in all forms of cell death, but it is only now coming into focus that ROS
control and determine the type of cell death that occurs in any given cell.
Indeed, ROS may act as a rheostat allowing different cell death mechanisms to be 
engaged and crosstalk with different cell death types. In this review, we will
describe the ROS regulatory pathways and how they control different types of cell
death under normal and disease states. We will also propose how ROS could provide
a mechanism of crosstalk between cell death mechanisms and act as a rheostat
determining the type of cell death.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics are lifesaving medicines, crucial for the treatment of
chronic or drug resistant infections. However, aminoglycosides are toxic to the
sensory hair cells in the inner ear. As a result, aminoglycoside-treated
individuals can develop permanent hearing loss and vestibular impairment. There
is considerable evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the
subsequent phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38) drives apoptosis in aminoglycoside-treated
hair cells. However, treatment strategies that directly inhibit ROS, JNK, or P38 
are limited by the importance of these molecules for normal cellular function.
Alternatively, the upstream regulator apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1
(ASK1/MAP3K5) is a key mediator of ROS-induced JNK and P38 activation under
pathologic but not homeostatic conditions. We investigated ASK1 as a mediator of 
drug-induced hair cell death using cochlear explants from Ask1 knockout mice,
demonstrating that Ask1 deficiency attenuates neomycin-induced hair cell death.
We then evaluated pharmacological inhibition of ASK1 with GS-444217 as a
potential otoprotective therapy. GS-444217 significantly attenuated hair cell
death in neomycin-treated explants but did not impact aminoglycoside efficacy
against P. aeruginosa in the broth dilution test. Overall, we provide significant
pre-clinical evidence that ASK1 inhibition represents a novel strategy for
preventing aminoglycoside ototoxicity. KEY MESSAGES: ASK1 is an upstream,
redox-sensitive regulator of P38 and JNK, which are known mediators of hair cell 
death. Ask1 knockout does not affect hair cell development in vivo, but
significantly reduces aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death in vitro. A
small-molecule inhibitor of ASK1 attenuates neomycin-induced hair cell death, and
does not impact antibiotic efficacy in vitro. ASK1 may be a novel molecular
target for preventing aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.

Immunogenic cell death (ICD) refers to a form of regulated cell death that
activates adaptive immunity, forming long-term immunological memory. Using
chemotherapeutic drugs to induce ICD in cancer cells can help create an inflamed,
immunogenic tumor environment, key for optimal immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
therapy response. ICB targets immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1). Durable 
responses and better quality of life in ICB patients compared with many other
treatments has prompted additional investigation into its therapeutic potential
and possible approaches, in an effort to further understand the functions of the 
costimulatory molecules and how new treatments may be designed. In this review,
we will summarize ICD induction, including stress responses, damage-associated
molecular patterns, and various assays by which immunogenicity is evaluated in
dying cells. In addition, the mechanisms and biomarkers underlying the CTLA4 and 
PD-1 pathways of checkpoint blockade will be covered. Finally, we will review the
synergistic effects of ICD induction combined with ICB therapy, as well as
combination blockade therapies involving the use of multiple drugs.

Cell death is an integral part of both infectious and sterile inflammatory
reactions. Many cell death pathways cause the dying cell to lyse, thereby
amplifying inflammation. A special form of lytic cell death is the formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), large structures of chromatin and
antimicrobial proteins, which are released by dying neutrophils to capture
extracellular pathogens and limit the spread of infections. The molecular
mechanisms of NET formation remain incompletely understood. Recent research
demonstrated substantial crosstalk between different cell death pathways, most
notably between apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis. Here, we review suicidal
and vital NET formation and discuss potential crosstalk of their mechanisms of
release with other forms of cell death.

The combination of the choline binding domain of the amidase
N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine (CLytA)-D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) (CLytA-DAAO) and
D-Alanine induces cell death in several pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma and
glioblastoma cell lines. In glioblastoma cell lines, CLytA-DAAO-induced cell
death was inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting a classical apoptotic 
cell death. Meanwhile, the cell death induced in pancreatic and colon carcinoma
cell lines is some type of programmed necrosis. In this article, we studied the
mechanisms that trigger CLytA-DAAO-induced cell death in pancreatic and
colorectal carcinoma and glioblastoma cell lines and we acquire a further insight
into the necrotic cell death induced in pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma cell 
lines. We have analyzed the intracellular calcium mobilization, mitochondrial
membrane potential, PARP-1 participation and AIF translocation. Although the
mitochondrial membrane depolarization plays a crucial role, our results suggest
that CLytA-DAAO-induced cell death is context dependent. We have previously
detected pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (Hs766T and HT-29,
respectively) that were resistant to CLytA-DAAO-induced cell death. In this
study, we have examined the putative mechanism underlying the resistance in these

Numerous disease states are associated with cell death. For many decades,
apoptosis and accidental necrosis have been assumed to be the two ways how a cell
can die. The recent discovery of additional cell death processes such as
necroptosis, ferroptosis or pyroptosis revealed a complex interplay between cell 
death mechanisms and diseases. Depending on the particular cell death pathway,
cells secrete distinct molecular patterns, which differ between cell death types.
This review focusses on released molecules, detectable in the blood flow, and
their potential role as circulating biomarkers of cell death. We elucidate the
molecular background of different biomarkers and give an overview on their
correlation with disease stage, therapy response and prognosis in patients.

BACKGROUND: Resistance to cell death, a protective mechanism for removing damaged
cells, is a "Hallmark of Cancer" that is essential for cancer progression.
Increasing attention to cancer lipid metabolism has revealed a number of pathways
that induce cancer cell death.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: We summarize emerging concepts regarding lipid metabolic
reprogramming in cancer that is mainly involved in lipid uptake and trafficking, 
de novo synthesis and esterification, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation,
lipogenesis, and lipolysis. During carcinogenesis and progression, continuous
metabolic adaptations are co-opted by cancer cells, to maximize their fitness to 
the ever-changing environmental. Lipid metabolism and the epigenetic modifying
enzymes interact in a bidirectional manner which involves regulating cancer cell 
death. Moreover, lipids in the tumor microenvironment play unique roles beyond
metabolic requirements that promote cancer progression. Finally, we posit
potential therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism to improve treatment 
efficacy and survival of cancer patient.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The profound comprehension of past findings, current trends,
and future research directions on resistance to cancer cell death will facilitate
the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the lipid metabolism.

Single Amino Acid Substitutions in the Cucumber Mosaic Virus 1a Protein Induce
Necrotic Cell Death in Virus-Inoculated Leaves without Affecting Virus
Multiplication.

When Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was inoculated with a series of
reassortant viruses created by exchanging viral genomic RNAs between two strains 
of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), CMV(Y), and CMV(H), cell death developed in the
leaves inoculated with reassortant CMV carrying CMV(H) RNA1 encoding 1a protein, 
but not in noninoculated upper leaves. In general, cell death in virus-infected
plants is a critical event for virus survival because virus multiplication is
completely dependent on host cell metabolism. However, interestingly, this
observed cell death did not affect either virus multiplication in the inoculated 
leaves or systemic spread to noninoculated upper leaves. Furthermore, the global 
gene expression pattern of the reassortant CMV-inoculated leaves undergoing cell 
death was clearly different from that in hypersensitive response (HR) cell death,
which is coupled with resistance to CMV. These results indicated that the
observed cell death does not appear to be HR cell death but rather necrotic cell 
death unrelated to CMV resistance. Interestingly, induction of this necrotic cell
death depended on single amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region
surrounding the methyltransferase domain of the 1a protein. Thus, development of 
necrotic cell death might not be induced by non-specific damage as a result of
virus multiplication, but by a virus protein-associated mechanism. The finding of
CMV 1a protein-mediated induction of necrotic cell death in A. thaliana, which is
not associated with virus resistance and HR cell death, has the potential to
provide a new pathosystem to study the role of cell death in virus-host plant
interactions.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as novel mediators of
intercellular communication. They work via delivering the sequestered cargo to
cells in the close vicinity, as well as distant sites in the body, regulating
pathophysiological processes. Cell death and inflammation are biologically
crucial processes in both normal physiology and pathology. These processes are
indistinguishably linked with their effectors modulating the other process. For
instance, during an unresolvable infection, the upregulation of specific immune
mediators leads to inflammation causing cell death and tissue damage. EVs have
gained considerable interest as mediators of both cell death and inflammation
during conditions, such as sepsis. This review summarizes the types of
extracellular vesicles known to date and their roles in mediating immune
responses leading to cell death and inflammation with specific focus on sepsis
and lung inflammation.

Ethylene response factors (ERFs) comprise one of the largest transcription factor
families in many plant species. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) ERF3 (NtERF3) and
other ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif-containing ERFs are known
to function as transcriptional repressors. NtERF3 and several repressor-type ERFs
induce cell death in tobacco leaves and are also associated with a defence
response against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). We investigated whether
transcriptional activator-type NtERFs function together with NtERF3 in the
defence response against TMV infection by performing transient ectopic
expression, together with gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
and promoter analyses. Transient overexpression of NtERF2 and NtERF4 induced cell
death in tobacco leaves, albeit later than that induced by NtERF3. Fusion of the 
EAR motif to the C-terminal end of NtERF2 and NtERF4 abolished their cell
death-inducing ability. The expression of NtERF2 and NtERF4 was upregulated at
the early phase of N gene-triggered hypersensitive response (HR) against TMV
infection. The cell death phenotype induced by overexpression of wild-type NtERF2
and NtERF4 was suppressed by co-expression of an EAR motif-deficient form of
NtERF3. Furthermore, ChIP and promoter analyses suggested that NtERF2, NtERF3 and
NtERF4 positively or negatively regulate the expression of NtERF3 by binding to
its promoter region. Overall, our results revealed the cell death-inducing
abilities of genes encoding activator-type NtERFs, including NtERF2 and NtERF4,
suggesting that the HR-cell death signalling via the repressor-type NtERF3 is
competitively but coordinately regulated by these NtERFs.

Cell death is a fundamental process in cardiac pathologies. Recent studies have
revealed multiple forms of cell death, and several of them have been demonstrated
to underlie adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure. With the expansion in
the area of myocardial cell death and increasing concerns over rigor and
reproducibility, it is important and timely to set a guideline for the best
practices of evaluating myocardial cell death. There are six major forms of
regulated cell death observed in cardiac pathologies, namely apoptosis,
necroptosis, mitochondrial-mediated necrosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and
autophagic cell death. In this article, we describe the best methods to identify,
measure, and evaluate these modes of myocardial cell death. In addition, we
discuss the limitations of currently practiced myocardial cell death mechanisms.

Pancreatic β-cells depend on the well-balanced regulation of cytosolic zinc
concentrations, providing sufficient zinc ions for the processing and storage of 
insulin, but avoiding toxic effects. The zinc transporter ZnT8, encoded by
SLC30A8,is a key player regarding islet cell zinc homeostasis, and polymorphisms 
in this gene are associated with altered type 2 diabetes susceptibility in man.
The objective of this study was to investigate the role of ZnT8 and zinc in
situations of cellular stress as hypoxia or inflammation. Isolated islets of WT
and global ZnT8-/- mice were exposed to hypoxia or cytokines and cell death was
measured. To explore the role of changing intracellular Zn2+ concentrations, WT
islets were exposed to different zinc concentrations using zinc chloride or the
zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN).
Hypoxia or cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL1-β) treatment induced islet cell death, but
to a lesser extent in islets from ZnT8-/- mice, which were shown to have a
reduced zinc content. Similarly, chelation of zinc with TPEN reduced cell death
in WT islets treated with hypoxia or cytokines, whereas increased zinc
concentrations aggravated the effects of these stressors. This study demonstrates
a reduced rate of cell death in islets from ZnT8-/- mice as compared to WT islets
when exposed to two distinct cellular stressors, hypoxia or cytotoxic cytokines. 
This protection from cell death is, in part, mediated by a reduced zinc content
in islet cells of ZnT8-/- mice. These findings may be relevant for altered
diabetes burden in carriers of risk SLC30A8 alleles in man.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) develops after a long period of human T-cell
leukemia virus (HTLV)-1 infection and is associated with host aging in addition
to genetic abnormalities in HTLV-1 infected cells. SIRT1 is a histone deacetylase
involved in cell cycle and apoptosis. We previously showed the high expression of
SIRT1 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ATL. There
have been many reports that SIRT1 inhibitors show tumor-suppressive effects. On
the other hand, SIRT1 activator SRT1720 induces the cell death of multiple
myeloma and breast cancer cells. However, the effect of SRT1720 on ATL is
unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SRT1720 on cell death in
leukemic cell lines in vitro and freshly isolated ATL cells ex vivo and in an ATL
in vivo mouse model. SRT1720 reduced cell viability in vitro and ex vivo.
Additionally, SRT1720 increased the number of apoptotic cells, as shown by
annexin V positive cells, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, cleaved
caspase-3, and fragmented DNA. SRT1720 also induced mitochondrial outer membrane 
permeabilization with the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and
autophagy. However, SIRT1 knockdown did not attenuate SRT1720-induced cell death 
in leukemic cell lines. Finally, SRT1720 treatment decreased the growth of human 
ATL tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Our study shows that while SRT1720 
does not target SIRT1, it induces cell death in ATL cells via apoptosis and
autophagy and has antitumor activity.

BACKGROUND: Anti-cancer therapy is more successful when it can also induce an
immunogenic form of cancer cell death (ICD). Therefore, when developing new
treatment strategies, it is extremely important to choose methods that induce ICD
and thereby activate anti-tumor immune response leading to the most effective
destruction of tumor cells. The aim of this work was to analyze whether the
clinically widely used photosensitizers, photosens (PS) and photodithazine (PD), 
can induce ICD when used in photodynamic therapy (PDT).
METHODS: Cell death in murine glioma GL261 or fibrosarcoma MCA205 cells was
induced by PS- or PD-PDT and cell death was analyzed by MTT or flow cytometry.
Intracellular distribution of PS and PD was studied by using the laser scanning
microscope. Calreticulin exposure and HMGB1 and ATP release were detected by flow
cytometry, ELISA and luminescence assay, respectively. Immunogenicity in vitro
was analyzed by co-culturing of dying cancer cells with bone-marrow derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs) and rate of phagocytosis and maturation (CD11c+CD86+,
CD11c+CD40+) of BMDCs and production of IL-6 in the supernatant were measured. In
vivo immunogenicity was analyzed in mouse tumor prophylactic vaccination model.
RESULTS: We determined the optimal concentrations of the photosensitizers and
found that at a light dose of 20 J/cm2 (λex 615-635 nm) both PS and PD
efficiently induced cell death in glioma GL261 and fibrosarcoma MCA205 cells. We 
demonstrate that PS localized predominantly in the lysosomes and that the cell
death induced by PS-PDT was inhibited by zVAD-fmk (apoptosis inhibitor) and by
ferrostatin-1 and DFO (ferroptosis inhibitors), but not by the necroptosis
inhibitor necrostatin-1 s. By contrast, PD accumulated in the endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and the cell death induced by PD-PDT was inhibited
only by z-VAD-fmk. Dying cancer cells induced by PS-PDT or PD-PDT emit
calreticulin, HMGB1 and ATP and they were efficiently engulfed by BMDCs, which
then matured, became activated and produced IL-6. Using dying cancer cells
induced by PS-PDT or PD-PDT, we demonstrate the efficient vaccination potential
of ICD in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results identify PS and PD as novel ICD inducers
that could be effectively combined with PDT in cancer therapy.

BRAF T1799A mutation is the most common genetic variation in thyroid cancer,
resulting in the production of BRAF V600E mutant protein reported to make cells
resistant to apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which BRAF V600E regulates cell
death remains unknown. We constructed BRAF V600E overexpression and knockdown
8505C and BCPAP papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer cell to investigate
regulatory mechanism of BRAF V600E in cell death induced by staurosporine (STS). 
Induced BRAF V600E expression attenuated STS-induced papillary and anaplastic
thyroid cancer death, while BRAF V600E knockdown aggravated it. TMRM and
calcein-AM staining showed that opening of the mitochondrial permeability
transition pore (mPTP) during STS-induced cell death could be significantly
inhibited by BRAF V600E. Moreover, our study demonstrated that BRAF V600E
constitutively activates mitochondrial ERK (mERK) to inhibit GSK-3-dependent CypD
phosphorylation, thereby making BRAF V600E mutant tumour cells more resistant to 
mPTP opening. In the mitochondria of BRAF V600E mutant cells, there was an
interaction between ERK1/2 and GSKa/ß, while upon BRAF V600E knockdown,
interaction of GSKa/ß to ERK was decreased significantly. These results show that
in thyroid cancer, BRAF V600E regulates the mitochondrial permeability transition
through the pERK-pGSK-CypD pathway to resist death, providing new intervention
targets for BRAF V600E mutant tumours.

Dendritic cells (DCs), as potent phagocytes engulf dead cells and present peptide
fragments of tumor antigens or pathogens derived from infected cells to naïve
CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Dendritic cells can also induce apoptosis in target cells,
thus getting an opportunity to sample their microenvironment. Here, we present
that the supernatants of LPS- or CL075-activated DCs induced cell death in
different cell lines, but during the differentiation to mature DCs, they lost
their cytotoxic potential. Dexamethasone-pre-treated tolerogenic DCs induced less
intensive death indicating that the tissue microenvironment can downregulate
DC-mediated killing. Exploring the signaling of DC-induced cell death, we
observed that the supernatant of activated DCs induced TNF-dependent cell death, 
since TNF antagonist blocked the cytotoxic activity of DCs, contrary to
inhibitors of Fas and TRAIL receptors. We identified that the DC-induced killing 
is at least partially a RIPK1-dependent process, as RIPK1 positive target cells
were more susceptible to DC-induced cell death than their RIPK1 deficient
counterparts. Moreover, both the elevated phosphorylation of RIPK1 and the
increase in RIPK1-caspase-8 interaction in target cells suggest that
RIPK1-mediated signals contribute to DC supernatant-induced cell death. We also
proved that the cytotoxic activity of DC-derived supernatant induced apoptosis in
the target cells and not necroptosis, as it was completely abrogated with the pan
caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD), while the necroptosis inhibitor (Nec-1) had no effect.
Our work revealed that the supernatant of activated DCs induces the apoptosis of 
target cells in a RIPK1-dependent manner. This phenomenon could be relevant for

Microorganisms cooperate with each other to protect themselves from environmental
stressors. An extreme case of such cooperation is regulated cell death for the
benefit of other cells. Dying cells can provide surviving cells with nutrients or
induce their stress response by transmitting an alarm signal; however, the role
of dead cells in microbial communities is unclear. Here, we searched for types of
stressors the protection from which can be achieved by death of a subpopulation
of cells. Thus, we compared the survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells upon
exposure to various stressors in the presence of additionally supplemented living
versus dead cells. We found that dead cells contribute to yeast community
resistance against macrolide antifungals (e.g., amphotericin B [AmB] and filipin)
to a greater extent than living cells. Dead yeast cells absorbed more macrolide
filipin than control cells because they exposed intracellular sterol-rich
membranes. We also showed that, upon the addition of lethal concentrations of
AmB, supplementation with AmB-sensitive cells but not with AmB-resistant cells
enabled the survival of wild-type cells. Together, our data suggest that
cell-to-cell heterogeneity in sensitivity to AmB can be an adaptive mechanism
helping yeast communities to resist macrolides, which are naturally occurring
antifungal agents. IMPORTANCE Eukaryotic microorganisms harbor elements of
programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms that are homologous to the PCD of
multicellular metazoa. However, it is still debated whether microbial PCD has an 
adaptive role or whether the processes of cell death are an aimless operation in 
self-regulating molecular mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that dying yeast
cells provide an instant benefit for their community by absorbing macrolides,
which are bacterium-derived antifungals. Our results illustrate the principle
that the death of a microorganism can contribute to the survival of its kin and
suggest that early plasma membrane permeabilization improves community-level
protection. The latter makes a striking contrast to the manifestations of
apoptosis in higher eukaryotes, the process by which plasma membranes maintain
integrity.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas signal molecule involved in
regulating plants tolerance to heavy metals stress. In this study, we
investigated the role of H2S in cadmium-(Cd-) induced cell death of root tips of 
cucumber seedlings.
RESULTS: The results showed that the application of 200 μM Cd caused cell death, 
increased the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), chromatin condensation,
the release of Cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria and activated
caspase-3-like protease. Pretreatment of seedlings with 100 μM sodium hydrogen
sulfide (NaHS, a H2S donor) effectively alleviated the growth inhibition and
reduced cell death of root tips caused by Cd stress. Additionally, NaHS + Cd
treatment could decrease the ROS level and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. 
Pretreatment with NaHS also inhibited the release of Cyt c from the mitochondria,
the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), and the
activity of caspase-3-like protease in the root tips of cucumber seedling under
Cd stress.
CONCLUSION: H2S inhibited Cd-induced cell death in cucumber root tips by reducing
ROS accumulation, activating the antioxidant system, inhibiting mitochondrial Cyt
c release and reducing the opening of the MPTP. The results suggest that H2S is a
negative regulator of Cd-induced cell death in the root tips of cucumber
seedling.

Zafirlukast Induces VHL- and HIF-2α-Dependent Oxidative Cell Death in 786-O Clear
Cell Renal Carcinoma Cells.

Mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are the driving force in many forms
of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and promote hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF)-dependent tumor proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Despite the
progress that has already been made, ccRCC generally remain resistant to
conventional therapies and ccRCC patients suffer from metastasis and acquired
resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options. Cysteinyl
leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) antagonists, like zafirlukast, are administered 
in bronchial asthma to control eicosanoid signaling. Intriguingly, long-term use 
of zafirlukast decreases cancer risk and leukotriene receptor antagonists inhibit
tumor growth, but the mechanisms still remain unexplored. Therefore, we aim to
understand the mechanisms of zafirlukast-mediated cell death in ccRCC cells. We
show that zafirlukast induces VHL-dependent and TNFα-independent non-apoptotic
and non-necroptotic cell death in ccRCC cells. Cell death triggered by
zafirlukast could be rescued with antioxidants and the PARP-1 inhibitor Olaparib,
and additionally relies on HIF-2α. Finally, MG-132-mediated proteasome inhibition
sensitized VHL wild-type cells to zafirlukast-induced cell death and inhibition
of HIF-2α rescued zafirlukast- and MG-132-triggered cell death. Together, these
results highlight the importance of VHL, HIF and proteasomal degradation in
zafirlukast-induced oxidative cell death with potentially novel therapeutic
implications for ccRCC.

Twelve regulated cell death programs have been described. We review in detail the
basic biology of nine including death receptor-mediated apoptosis, death
receptor-mediated necrosis (necroptosis), mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis,
mitochondrial-mediated necrosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, ferroptosis,
pyroptosis, parthanatos, and immunogenic cell death. This is followed by a
dissection of the roles of these cell death programs in the major cardiac
syndromes: myocardial infarction and heart failure. The most important conclusion
relevant to heart disease is that regulated forms of cardiomyocyte death play
important roles in both myocardial infarction with reperfusion
(ischemia/reperfusion) and heart failure. While a role for apoptosis in
ischemia/reperfusion cannot be excluded, regulated forms of necrosis, through
both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways, are critical. Ferroptosis and
parthanatos are also likely important in ischemia/reperfusion, although it is
unclear if these entities are functioning as independent death programs or as
amplification mechanisms for necrotic cell death. Pyroptosis may also contribute 
to ischemia/reperfusion injury, but potentially through effects in
non-cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte loss through apoptosis and necrosis is also an 
important component in the pathogenesis of heart failure and is mediated by both 
death receptor and mitochondrial signaling. Roles for immunogenic cell death in
cardiac disease remain to be defined but merit study in this era of immune
checkpoint cancer therapy. Biology-based approaches to inhibit cell death in the 
various cardiac syndromes are also discussed.

Many tumors develop resistance to most of the apoptosis-based cancer therapies.
In this sense targeting non-apoptotic forms of cell death including necroptosis, 
autophagy and ferroptosis may have therapeutic benefits in apoptosis-defective
cancer cells. Nanomaterials have shown great advantages in cancer treatment owing
to their unique characteristics. Besides, the capability of nanomaterials to
induce different forms of cell death has gained widespread attention in cancer
treatment. Reports in this field reflect the therapeutic potential of necroptotic
cell death induced by nanomaterials in cancer. Also, autophagic cell death
induced by nanomaterials alone and as a part of chemo-, radio- and photothermal
therapy holds great promise as anticancer therapeutic option. Besides,
ferroptosis induction by iron-based nanomaterials in drug delivery,
immunotherapy, hyperthermia and imaging systems shows promising results in
malignancies. Hence, this review is devoted to the latest efforts and the
challenges in this field of research and its clinical merits.

Infections with bacterial pathogens often results in the initiation of programmed
cell death as part of the host innate immune defense, or as a bacterial virulence
strategy. Induction of host cell death is controlled by an elaborate network of
innate immune and cell death signaling pathways and manifests in different
morphologically and functionally distinct forms of death, such as apoptosis,
necroptosis, NETosis and pyroptosis. The mechanism by which host cell death
restricts bacterial replication is highly cell-type and context depended, but its
physiological importance is highlighted the diversity of strategies bacterial
pathogens use to avoid induction of cell death or to block cell death signaling
pathways. In this review, we discuss the latest insights into how bacterial
pathogens elicit and manipulate cell death signaling, how different forms of cell
death kill or restrict bacteria and how cell death and innate immune pathway
cross talk to guard against pathogen-induced inhibition of host cell death.

Background: Sepsis is considered an intractable dysfunction that results from the
disordered host immune response to uncontrolled infection. Even though the
precise mechanism of sepsis remains unclear, scientific advances have highlighted
the key role of various programmed cell death processes in the pathophysiology of
sepsis. The current study aims to explore the worldwide research trend on
programmed cell death in the setting of sepsis and assesses the achievements of
publications from various countries, institutions, journals, and authors
globally.
Material and methods: Associated publications during 2002-2022 with the topical
subject of sepsis and programmed cell death were extracted from the Web of
Science. VOSviewer was utilized to evaluate and map the published trend in the
relevant fields.
Results: All 2,037 relevant manuscripts with a total citation of 71,575 times
were screened out by the end of 1 January 2022. China accounted for the largest
number of publications (45.07%) and was accompanied by corporate citations
(11,037) and H-index (48), which ranked second globally. The United States has
been ranked first place with the highest citations (30,775) and H-index (88),
despite a low publication number (29.95%), which was subsequent to China. The
journal Shock accounted for the largest number of publications in this area. R.
S. Hotchkiss, affiliated with Washington University, was considered to have
published the most papers in the relevant fields (57) and achieved the highest
citation frequencies (9,523). The primary keywords on the topic of programmed
cell death in sepsis remarkably focused on "inflammation" "immunosuppression",
and "oxidative stress", which were recognized as the core mechanisms of sepsis,
eventually attributing to programmed cell death. The involved research on
programmed cell death induced by immune dysregulation of sepsis was undoubtedly
the hotspot in the pertinent areas.
Conclusions: The United States has been academically outstanding in
sepsis-related research. There appears to be an incompatible performance between 
publications and quantity with China. Frontier advances may be consulted in the
journal Shock. The leading-edge research on the scope of programmed cell death in
sepsis should preferably focus on immune dissonance-related studies in the
future.

BACKGROUND: The electromechanical function of myocardial tissue depends on the
intercellular communication between cardiomyocytes (CMs) as well as their
crosstalk with other cell types. Cell injury, and subsequent death trigger
inflammation as in myocardial infarction (MI) resulting in myocardial remodeling.
Although mechanisms underlying myocardial cell death have been studied so far,
the signaling events following single cell death and spontaneous response of
connected cells in the myocardial tissue is still barely understood.
METHODS: Here, we investigated the effect of laser-induced single cell death on
Calcium (Ca2+) concentrations and transport in myocardial cell clusters in vitro.
Spatial and temporal changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations [Ca2+]i were
studied using a fluorescent calcium indicator, Fluo-4AM. Spontaneous signaling
events following cell death were studied in rat embryonic cardiomyocytes and
non-myocytes using separate cell culture systems.
RESULTS: Cell death triggered spontaneous increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels
([Ca2+]i) of surrounding cells. The spread of the observed propagating Ca2+
signal was slow and sustained in myocytes while it was rapid and transient in
fibroblasts (Fbs). Further, sustained high Ca2+ levels temporarily impaired the
contractility in CMs. The cell-type specific effect of ablation was confirmed
using separate cultures of CMs and Fbs. Comparing Ca2+ propagation speed in
myocytes and fibroblasts, we argue for a diffusion-driven Ca2+ propagation in
myocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Radial and sequential Ca2+ diffusion across the
CMs through cell-cell contacts and presence of Cx43-based intercellular junctions
indicated a gap junction flow of Ca2+.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the spontaneous Ca2+-mediated functional
interplay in myocardial cell clusters upon mechanical injury and, further, the
difference in Ca2+ signaling in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Video Abstract.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death process, was found to occur in
Magnaporthe oryzae, and plays a key role in infection-related development
therein. Ferroptosis in the rice-blast fungus was confirmed based on five basic
criteria. We confirmed the dependence of ferroptosis on ferric ions, and
optimized ratio-fluorescence imaging of C11-BODIPY581/591 as a precise sensor for
lipid peroxides that mediate ferroptosis in M. oryzae. We uncovered an important 
regulatory function for reduced glutathione and NADPH oxidases in modulating the 
superoxide moieties required for ferroptotic cell death. We found ferroptosis to 
be necessary for the developmental cell death of conidia during appressorium
maturation in rice blast. Such ferroptotic cell death initiated first in the
terminal cell and progressed sequentially to the entire conidium. Iron chelation 
or chemical inhibition of ferroptosis caused conidial cells to remain viable, and
led to strong defects in host invasion by M. oryzae. Ferroptosis induction
exclusively in the host severely constrained the invasive growth of M. oryzae. We
found inter-reliant and independent roles for ferroptosis and autophagy in
controlling such precise cell death in M. oryzae during pathogenic
differentiation. Our study provides significant molecular insights into the role 
of developmental cell death and iron homeostasis in fungal pathogenesis.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a severe health threat due to its association
with microcephaly. It has been reported that the strong cytopathic effects,
including cell-cycle arrest and cell death are responsible for the nervous system
disease. However, the mechanisms by which ZIKV infection induced cell death were 
largely unknown. Here, we reported that cell death is readily detected after ZIKV
infection as indicated by PI staining and the reduction of cell viability.
Importantly, cell death can be induced by overexpression of ZIKV NS3 protein
alone but not the other non-structure proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis
revealed that NS3 bond to and activated PARP-1. In agreement with these
observations, we found that PARP-1 was massively activated during ZIKV infection 
and the intracellular ATP and NAD+ concentrations rapidly declined. Finally,
PARP-1 knockdown simultaneously restrained ZIKV infection-induced cell death and 
ablated host restriction of virus infection. Our finding indicates that PARP-1
activation is an important cellular event during ZIKV infection, which
contributes to the cell death.

Cell death is a vital process that occurs in billions of cells in the human body 
every day. This process helps maintain tissue homeostasis, supports recovery from
acute injury, deals with infection and regulates immunity. Cell death can also
provoke inflammatory responses, and lytic forms of cell death can incite
inflammation. Loss of cell membrane integrity leads to the uncontrolled release
of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are normally sequestered
inside cells. Such DAMPs increase local inflammation and promote the production
of cytokines and chemokines that modulate the innate immune response. Cell death 
can be both a consequence and a cause of inflammation, which can be difficult to 
distinguish in chronic diseases. Despite this caveat, excessive or poorly
regulated cell death is increasingly recognized as a contributor to chronic
inflammation in rheumatic disease and other inflammatory conditions. Drugs that
inhibit cell death could, therefore, be used therapeutically for the treatment of
these diseases, and programmes to develop such inhibitors are already underway.
In this Review, we outline pathways for the major cell death programmes
(apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and NETosis) and their potential roles in
chronic inflammation. We also discuss current and developing therapies that
target the cell death machinery.

Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 critically controls cell death by neutralizing pro-apoptotic
Bcl-2-family members at the mitochondria. Bcl-2 proteins also act at the
endoplasmic reticulum, the main intracellular Ca2+-storage organelle, where they 
inhibit IP3 receptors (IP3R) and prevent pro-apoptotic Ca2+-signaling events.
IP3R channels are targeted by the BH4 domain of Bcl-2. Some cancer types rely on 
the IP3R-Bcl-2 interaction for survival. We previously developed a
cell-permeable, BH4-domain-targeting peptide that can abrogate Bcl-2's inhibitory
action on IP3Rs, named Bcl-2 IP3 receptor disrupter-2 (BIRD-2). This peptide
kills several Bcl-2-dependent cancer cell types, including diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, by eliciting
intracellular Ca2+ signalling. However, the exact mechanisms by which these
excessive Ca2+ signals triggered by BIRD-2 provoke cancer cell death remain
elusive. Here, we demonstrate in DLBCL that although BIRD-2 activates caspase 3/7
and provokes cell death in a caspase-dependent manner, the cell death is
independent of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members, Bim, Bax and Bak. Instead,
BIRD-2 provokes mitochondrial Ca2+ overload that is rapidly followed by opening
of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Inhibiting
mitochondrial Ca2+ overload using Ru265, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+
uniporter complex counteracts BIRD-2-induced cancer cell death. Finally, we
validated our findings in primary CLL patient samples where BIRD-2 provoked
mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and Ru265 counteracted BIRD-2-induced cell death.
Overall, this work reveals the mechanisms by which BIRD-2 provokes cell death,
which occurs via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload but acts independently of
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members.

The interaction between the activation of protein phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN),
and the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of
activated T-cells (NFAT), a transcriptional factor in the immune system, has
attracted interest as a key factor responsible for the cell death process. In
this study, the effects of melatonin on the interaction between CaN and NFAT
signaling during oxidative stress-induced cell death were investigated. Human
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the non-radical reactive oxygen
species hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cells were treated with 200 μM H2O2 for the
indicated time. Some H2O2-treated cells were pretreated with melatonin for 1 h.
Control cells were treated with the same concentration of ethanol used to dilute 
melatonin. H2O2-induced cell death promoted increases in reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) production and the nuclear translocation of NFAT, which were related to
increased levels the active, cleaved form of CaN (32.5 kDa). In addition,
pretreatment of H2O2-treated cells with melatonin decreased cell death, ROS
production, the levels of the active-cleaved form of CaN and the nuclear
translocation of NFAT. Based on these findings, melatonin may exert its
neuroprotective effects on oxidative damage-induced cell death by inhibiting
CaN-activated the nuclear translocation of NFAT.

Developmental neuron death plays a pivotal role in refining organization and
wiring during neocortex formation. Aberrant regulation of this process results in
neurodevelopmental disorders including impaired learning and memory. Underlying
molecular pathways are incompletely determined. Loss of Bcl11a in cortical
projection neurons induces pronounced cell death in upper-layer cortical
projection neurons during postnatal corticogenesis. We use this genetic model to 
explore genetic mechanisms by which developmental neuron death is controlled.
Unexpectedly, we find Bcl6, previously shown to be involved in the transition of 
cortical neurons from progenitor to postmitotic differentiation state to provide 
a major checkpoint regulating neuron survival during late cortical development.
We show that Bcl11a is a direct transcriptional regulator of Bcl6. Deletion of
Bcl6 exerts death of cortical projection neurons. In turn, reintroduction of Bcl6
into Bcl11a mutants prevents induction of cell death in these neurons. Together, 
our data identify a novel Bcl11a/Bcl6-dependent molecular pathway in regulation
of developmental cell death during corticogenesis.

Plant organ growth is widely accepted to be determined by cell division and cell 
expansion, but, unlike that in animals, the contribution of cell elimination has 
rarely been recognized. We investigated this paradigm during Arabidopsis lateral 
root formation, when the lateral root primordia (LRP) must traverse three
overlying cell layers within the parent root. A subset of LRP-overlying cells
displayed the induction of marker genes for cell types undergoing developmental
cell death, and their cell death was detected by electron, confocal, and light
sheet microscopy techniques. LRP growth was delayed in cell-death-deficient
mutants lacking the positive cell death regulator ORESARA1/ANAC092 (ORE1). LRP
growth was restored in ore1-2 knockout plants by genetically inducing cell
elimination in cells overlying the LRP or by physically killing LRP-overlying
cells by ablation with optical tweezers. Our results support that, in addition to
previously discovered mechanisms, cell elimination contributes to regulating
lateral root emergence.

School, 7624 Pecs, Hungary.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) was first isolated as 
a hypothalamic peptide based on its efficacy to increase adenylate cyclase (AC)
activity. It has a widespread distribution throughout the body including the
nervous system and peripheral organs, where PACAP exerts protective effects both 
in vivo and in vitro through its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and
antioxidant functions. The aim of the present paper was to review the currently
available literature regarding the effects of PACAP on cell death in vitro in
neural and non-neural cells. Among others, its effect on apoptosis can be
detected in cerebellar granule cells against different toxic stimuli. Different
neural cell types from the cerebral cortex are also prevented from cell death.
PACAP also shows effects on cell death in cells belonging to the peripheral
nervous system and protects both neural and non-neural cells of sensory organs.
In addition, cell survival-promoting effect can be observed in different
peripheral organ systems including cardiovascular, immune, respiratory,
gastrointestinal, urinary, and reproductive systems. The studies summarized here 
indicate its noteworthy effect on cell death in different in vitro models,
suggesting PACAP's potential therapeutic usage in several pathological
conditions.

OBJECTIVE: The secondary injury caused by RBC autolysis after intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) can be reduced by increasing the efficiency of microglia
(MG)/macrophages (Mø) phagocytizing red blood cells (RBCs). CD47 is an important 
regulator of MG/Mø phagocytosis. This study aims to clarify whether anti-CD47
antibody administrated into the cisterna magna after ICH can transfer to the
hematoma site, promote MG/Mø gathering to phagocytize RBCs and ultimately reduce 
cell death.
METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into sham, ICH, low-dosage (group A,
0.3 μg), medium-dosage (group B, 0.9 μg) and high-dosage (group C, 1.8 μg)
anti-CD47 antibody groups. For the rats in group A, B and C, anti-CD47 antibody
solution was administrated into the cisterna magna at 10 min after ICH. Brain
tissue was harvested 3 days after the operation. Western blotting was performed
to detect the expression of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2. Immunofluorescence was performed
to detect the CD68 expression. TUNEL was performed to detect the cell death.
RESULTS: The hematoma of the ICH rats was located in the basal ganglia, with a
good homogeneity of hematoma volume. Low-dosage anti-CD47 antibody in group A had
no effects on the perihematomal CD68 (P = 0.338), Caspase-3 (P = 0.769), Bcl-2 (P
= 0.176) expression and cell death (P = 0.698), compared with the ICH group. CD68
and Bcl-2 expression increased and Caspase-3 expression decreased significantly
in group B (P < 0.001 for all) and group C (P < 0.001 for all). The increase of
CD68 expression in group C was greater than that in group B (P < 0.01) by a large
margin, while there was no difference for Bcl-2 (P = 0.908) and Caspase-3 (P =
0.913) expression between the 2 groups. Compared with the ICH group,
medium-dosage of anti-CD47 antibody in group B significantly reduced the number
of TUNEL-positive cells (P < 0.005), but not for group C (P = 0.311).
CONCLUSION: The results suggested that anti-CD47 antibody administration into the
cisterna magna in proper dosage (0.9 μg) can effectively reach the hematoma,
induce more MG/Møs to gather around the hematoma, and reduce cell death in
perihematomal brain tissue. The results of this study has provided a basic theory
for improving the efficiency of MG/Mø phagocytizing RBCs and hematoma clearance
after ICH by administrating anti-CD47 antibody via the cisterna magna.

In monocarpic plants, stem cells are fated to die. However, the potential
mechanism of stem cell death has remained elusive. Here, we reveal that the
levels of two forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion free
radical (O2·-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), show dynamic changes in the shoot
apex during the plant life cycle of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the level
of O2·- decreased and disappeared at four weeks after bolting (WAB), while H2O2
appeared at 3 WAB and showed a burst at 5 WAB. The timing of dynamic changes in
O2·- and H2O2 was delayed for approximately three weeks in clv3-2, which has a
longer lifespan. Moreover, exogenous application of H2O2 inhibited the expression
of the stem cell determinant WUSCHEL (WUS) and promoted the expression of the
developmentally programmed cell death (dPCD) marker gene ORESARA 1 (ORE1). These 
results indicate that H2O2 triggers an important signal inducing dPCD in stem
cells. Given that O2·- plays roles in maintaining WUS expression and stem cell
activity, we speculate that the dynamic shift from O2·- to H2O2 in the shoot apex
results in stem cell death. Our findings provide novel insights for understanding
ROS-mediated regulation during plant stem cell death.

Despite technological advances in cancer treatment, the survival rate of patients
with head and neck cancer (HNC) has not improved significantly. Many studies have
shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related signals are associated with 
mitochondrial damage and that these signals determine whether cells maintain
homeostasis or activate cell death programs. The unfolded protein response (UPR) 
is regulated by ER membrane proteins such as double-stranded RNA-activated
protein kinase R(PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), which directly activate
transcription of chaperones or genes that function in redox homeostasis, protein 
secretion, or cell death programs. In this study, we focused on the role of
mitophagy and ER stress-mediated cell death induced by DIM-C-pPhtBu in HNC
cancer. We found that DIM-C-pPhtBu, a compound that activates ER stress in many
cancers, induced lysosomal dysfunction, excessive mitophagy, and cell death in
HNC cells. Moreover, DIM-C-pPhtBu strongly inhibited HNC progression in a
xenograft model by altering mitophagy related protein expression. Taken together,
the results demonstrate that DIM-C-pPhtBu induces excessive mitophagy and
eventually UPR-mediated cell death in HNC cells, suggesting that new anti-cancer 
drugs could be developed based on the connection between mitophagy and cancer
cell death.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity and their various
comorbidities have continued to rise. In skeletal muscle lipotoxicity is well
known to be a contributor to the development of insulin resistance. Here it was
examined if the small molecule adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon mimicked the
effect of adiponectin to attenuate palmitate induced reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production and cell death in L6 skeletal muscle cells.
METHODS: L6 cells were treated ±0.1 mM PA, and ± AdipoRon, then assays analyzing 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death, and intracellular and
extracellular levels of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) were conducted. To
determine the mechanistic role of S1P gain (using exogenous S1P or using THI) or 
loss of function (using the SKI-II) were conducted.
RESULTS: Using both CellROX and DCFDA assays it was found that AdipoRon reduced
palmitate-induced ROS production. Image-IT DEAD, MTT and LDH assays all indicated
that AdipoRon reduced palmitate-induced cell death. Palmitate significantly
increased intracellular accumulation of S1P, whereas in the presence of AdipoRon 
there was increased release of S1P from cells to extracellular medium. It was
also observed that direct addition of extracellular S1P prevented
palmitate-induced ROS production and cell death, indicating that S1P is acting in
an autocrine manner. Pharmacological approaches to enhance or decrease S1P levels
indicated that accumulation of intracellular S1P correlated with enhanced cell
death.
CONCLUSION: This data indicates that increased extracellular levels of S1P in
response to adiponectin receptor activation can activate S1P receptor-mediated
signaling to attenuate lipotoxic cell death. Taken together these findings
represent a possible novel mechanism for the protective action of adiponectin.

xCT, also known as solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), the light chain
of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, is positively correlated with cancer
progression due to antioxidant function. During glucose deprivation, the
overexpression of xCT does not protect cancer cells but instead promotes cell
death. Further understanding the mechanism of glucose deprivation-induced cell
death is important for developing anticancer treatments targeting the glucose
metabolism. In this study, we found that breast cancer cells with a high
expression of xCT demonstrated increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
and were more sensitive to glucose deprivation than the cells with a low
expression of xCT. However, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) did not
significantly affect glucose-deprivation-induced cell death. The antioxidant
N-acetyl-cysteine prevented glucose-deprivation-induced cell death, and the
glutathione biosynthesis inhibitor L-buthionine-S, R-sulfoximine enhanced
glucose-deprivation-induced cell death. The inhibition of xCT by sulfasalazine or
a knockdown of xCT reduced the glucose-deprivation-increased ROS levels and
glucose-deprivation-induced cell death. Glucose deprivation reduced the
intracellular glutamate, and supplementation with α-ketoglutarate prevented the
glucose-deprivation-increased ROS levels and rescued cell death. The knockdown of
sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) further enhanced the ROS levels, and promoted xCT-related cell 
death after glucose deprivation. In conclusion, our results suggested that ROS
play a critical role in xCT-dependent cell death in breast cancer cells under
glucose deprivation.

Receptor-interacting serine threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) has emerged as a
central molecular switch in controlling the balance between cell survival and
cell death. The pro-survival role of RIPK1 in maintaining cell survival is
achieved via its ability to induce NF-κB-dependent expression of anti-apoptotic
genes. However, recent advances have identified the pro-death function of RIPK1: 
posttranslational modifications of RIPK1 in the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 
(TNFR1)-associated complex-I, in the cytosolic complex-IIb or in necrosomes
regulate the cytotoxic potential of RIPK1, forming an early cell death
checkpoint. Since the kinase activity of RIPK1 is indispensable in RIPK3- and
MLKL-mediated necroptosis induction, while it is dispensable in apoptosis, a
better understanding of this early cell death checkpoint via RIPK1 might lead to 
new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling both apoptotic and
necroptotic modes of cell death and help develop novel therapeutic approaches for
cancer. Here, we present an emerging view of the regulatory mechanisms for RIPK1 
activity, especially with respect to the early cell death checkpoint. We also
discuss the impact of dysregulated RIPK1 activity in pathophysiological settings 
and highlight its therapeutic potential in treating human diseases.

Plants utilize a two-tiered immune system consisting of pattern recognition
receptor (PRR)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) to 
defend themselves against pathogenic microbes. The receptor protein kinase BAK1
plays a central role in multiple PTI signaling pathways in Arabidopsis However,
double mutants made by BAK1 and its closest paralog BKK1 exhibit autoimmune
phenotypes, including cell death resembling a typical nucleotide-binding
leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR)-mediated ETI response. The molecular mechanisms
of the cell death caused by the depletion of BAK1 and BKK1 are poorly understood.
Here, we show that the cell-death phenotype of bak1 bkk1 is suppressed when a
group of NLRs, ADR1s, are mutated, indicating the cell-death of bak1 bkk1 is the 
consequence of NLR activation. Furthermore, introduction of a Pseudomonas
syringae effector HopB1, which proteolytically cleaves activated BAK1 and its
paralogs via either gene transformation or bacterium-delivery, results in a
cell-death phenotype in an ADR1s-dependent manner. Our study thus pinpoints that 
BAK1 and its paralogs are likely guarded by NLRs.

Regulated cell death (RCD) is pivotal in directing the severity and outcome of
liver injury. Hepatocyte cell death is a critical event in the progression of
liver disease due to resultant inflammation leading to fibrosis. Apoptosis,
necrosis, necroptosis, autophagy, and recently, pyroptosis and ferroptosis, have 
all been investigated in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. These cell
death subroutines display distinct features, while sharing many similar
characteristics with considerable overlap and crosstalk. Multiple types of cell
death modes can likely coexist, and the death of different liver cell populations
may contribute to liver injury in each type of disease. This review addresses the
known signaling cascades in each cell death pathway and its implications in liver
disease. In this review, we describe the common findings in each disease model,
as well as the controversies and the limitations of current data with a
particular focus on cell death-related research in humans and in rodent models of
alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis
(NASH/NAFLD), acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity, autoimmune hepatitis, 
cholestatic liver disease, and viral hepatitis.

The immunogenicity of dying cancer cells determines the efficacy of anti-cancer
therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD),
which is characterized by the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) from dying cells. This emission can trigger effective anti-tumor
immunity. Only a few photosensitizers are known to induce ICD and, therefore,
there is a need for development of new photosensitizers that can induce ICD. The 
purpose of this work was to analyze whether photosensitizers developed in-house
from porphyrazines (pz I and pz III) can induce ICD in vitro and in vivo when
used in PDT. We indetified the optimal concentrations of the photosensitizers and
found that, at a light dose of 20 J/cm2 (λex 615-635 nm), both pz I and pz III
efficiently induced cell death in cancer cells. We demonstrate that pz I
localized predominantly in the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes while pz III in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. The cell death induced by pz I-PDT was
inhibited by zVAD-fmk (apoptosis inhibitor) but not by ferrostatin-1 and DFO
(ferroptosis inhibitors) or by necrostatin-1 s (necroptosis inhibitor). By
contrast, the cell death induced by pz III-PDT was inhibited by z-VAD-fmk and by 
the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1 s. Cancer cells induced by pz I-PDT or
pz III-PDT released HMGB1 and ATP and were engulfed by bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells, which then matured and became activated in vitro. We demonstrate
that cancer cells, after induction of cell death by pz I-PDT or pz III-PDT, are
protective when used in the mouse model of prophylactic tumor vaccination. By
vaccinating immunodeficient mice, we prove the role of the adaptive immune system
in protecting against tumours. All together, we have shown that two novel
porphyrazines developed in-house are potent ICD inducers that could be
effectively applied in PDT of cancer.

Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death, and pyroptosis-associated
inflammatory response is closely associated with the pathogenesis of acute lung
injury (ALI). Sevoflurane, a common clinical anesthetic, has been reported as
therapeutic drug for ALI. However, the detailed mechanisms by which sevoflurane
ameliorates ALI have not been fully delineated. In this study, we found that
sevoflurane phosphorylated and activated the GSK-3β to suppress LPS-induced
pyroptotic cell death, inflammation and ALI. Specifically, in the LPS-induced ALI
mice models, sevoflurane attenuated lung damages and fibrosis, and restrained the
production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Also, LPS increased the expression 
levels of pyroptosis-related proteins to promote pyroptotic cell death in ALI
mice lung tissues, and LPS-induced pyroptotic cell death was reduced by
sevoflurane co-treatment. Moreover, the potential underlying mechanisms were
uncovered, and we illustrated that sevoflurane promoted GSK-3β activation in
LPS-treated ALI mice lung tissues, and re-activation of GSK-3β by the PI3K/Akt
pathway inhibitor LY294002 suppressed LPS-induced pyroptotic cell death in vivo. 
Consistently, in the in vitro macrophages, our data hinted that LPS-induced
pyroptotic cell death were also reversed by sevoflurane. Collectively, the above 
results suggest that sevoflurane re-activated GSK-3β to suppress LPS-induced
pyroptotic cell death, inflammation and ALI.

Opportunistic pathogen Vibrio vulnificus causes severe systemic infection in
humans with high mortality. Although multiple exotoxins have been characterized
in V. vulnificus, their interactions and potential synergistic roles in
pathogen-induced host cell death have not been investigated previously. By
employing a series of multiple exotoxin deletion mutants, we investigated whether
specific exotoxins of the pathogen functioned together to achieve severe and
rapid necrotic cell death. Human epithelial cells treated with V. vulnificus with
a plpA deletion background exhibited an unusually prolonged cell blebbing,
suggesting the importance of PlpA, a phospholipase A2, in rapid necrotic cell
death by this pathogen. Additional deletion of the rtxA gene encoding the
multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxin did not result in
necrotic cell blebs. However, if the rtxA gene was engineered to produce an
effector-free MARTX toxin, the cell blebbing was observed, indicating that the
pore forming activity of the MARTX toxin is sufficient, but the MARTX toxin
effector domains are not necessary, for the blebbing. When a recombinant PlpA was
treated on the blebbed cells, the blebs were completely disrupted. Consistent
with this, MARTX toxin-pendent rapid release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase
was significantly delayed in the plpA deletion background. Mutations in other
exotoxins such as elastase, cytolysin/hemolysin, and/or extracellular
metalloprotease did not affect the bleb formation or disruption. Together, these 
findings indicate that the pore forming MARTX toxin and the phospholipase A2,
PlpA, cooperate sequentially to achieve rapid necrotic cell death by inducing
cell blebbing and disrupting the blebs, respectively.

TNF ligation of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) promotes either inflammation and cell
survival by (a) inhibiting RIPK1's death-signaling function and activating NF-κB 
or (b) causing RIPK1 to associate with the death-inducing signaling complex to
initiate apoptosis or necroptosis. The cellular source of TNF that results in
RIPK1-dependent cell death remains unclear. To address this, we employed in vitro
systems and murine models of T cell-dependent transplant or tumor rejection in
which target cell susceptibility to RIPK1-dependent cell death could be
genetically altered. We show that TNF released by T cells is necessary and
sufficient to activate RIPK1-dependent cell death in target cells and thereby
mediate target cell cytolysis independently of T cell frequency. Activation of
the RIPK1-dependent cell death program in target cells by T cell-derived TNF
accelerates murine cardiac allograft rejection and synergizes with anti-PD1
administration to destroy checkpoint blockade-resistant murine melanoma.
Together, the findings uncover a distinct immunological role for TNF released by 
cytotoxic effector T cells following cognate interactions with their antigenic
targets. Manipulating T cell TNF and/or target cell susceptibility to
RIPK1-dependent cell death can be exploited to either mitigate or augment T
cell-dependent destruction of allografts and malignancies to improve outcomes.

Programmed cell death (PCD), a highly regulated feature of the plant immune
response, involves multiple molecular players. Remorins (REMs) are plant-specific
proteins with varied biological functions, but their function in PCD and plant
defense remains largely unknown. Here, we report a role for remorin in disease
resistance, immune response, and PCD regulation. Overexpression of tomato
(Solanum lycopersicum) REMORIN1 (SlREM1) increased susceptibility of tomato to
the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and heterologous expression of this gene
triggered cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Further investigation
indicated that amino acids 173 to 187 and phosphorylation of SlREM1 played key
roles in SlREM1-triggered cell death. Intriguingly, multiple tomato REMs induced 
cell death in N benthamiana leaves. Yeast two-hybrid, split luciferase
complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated that remorin
proteins could form homo- and heterocomplexes. Using isobaric tags for relative
and absolute quantitative proteomics, we identified that some proteins related to
cell death regulation, as well as N benthamiana RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG
B (which is essential for reactive oxygen species production), were notably
upregulated in SlREM1-expressing leaves. Heterologous expression of SlREM1
increased reactive oxygen species accumulation and triggered other cell death
regulators. Our findings indicate that SlREM1 is a positive regulator of plant
cell death and provide clues for understanding the PCD molecular regulatory
network in plants.

Intestinal homeostasis and the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier
are essential components of host defense during gastrointestinal Salmonella
Typhimurium infection. Both require a strict regulation of cell death. However,
the molecular pathways regulating epithelial cell death have not been completely 
understood. Here, we elucidated the contribution of central mechanisms of
regulated cell death and upstream regulatory components during gastrointestinal
infection. Mice lacking Caspase-8 in the intestinal epithelium are highly
sensitive towards bacterial induced enteritis and intestinal inflammation,
resulting in an enhanced lethality of these mice. This phenotype was associated
with an increased STAT1 activation during Salmonella infection. Cell death,
barrier breakdown and systemic infection were abrogated by an additional deletion
of STAT1 in Casp8ΔIEC mice. In the absence of epithelial STAT1, loss of
epithelial cells was abolished which was accompanied by a reduced Caspase-8
activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that epithelial STAT1 acts upstream
of Caspase-8-dependent as well as -independent cell death and thus might play a
major role at the crossroad of several central cell death pathways in the
intestinal epithelium. In summary, we uncovered that transcriptional control of
STAT1 is an essential host response mechanism that is required for the
maintenance of intestinal barrier function and host survival.

BACKGROUND: Inhaled nanoparticles can cross pulmonary air-blood barrier into
circulation and cause vascular endothelial injury and progression of
cardiovascular disease. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the vascular 
toxicity of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) remains unclear. We have recently
demonstrated that the release of copper ions and the accumulation of superoxide
anions contributed to CuONPs-induced cell death in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs). Herein, we further demonstrate the mechanism
underlying copper ions-induced cell death in HUVECs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CuONPs were suspended in culture medium and vigorously
vortexed for several seconds before exposure. After treatment with CuONPs, HUVECs
were collected, and cell function assays were conducted to elucidate cellular
processes including cell viability, oxidative stress, DNA damage and cell
signaling pathways. We demonstrated that CuONPs uptake induced DNA damage in
HUVECs as evidenced by γH2AX foci formation and increased phosphorylation levels 
of ATR, ATM, p53 and H2AX. Meanwhile, we showed that CuONPs exposure induced
oxidative stress, indicated by the increase of cellular levels of superoxide
anions, the upregulation of protein levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and
glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), the elevation of the levels of
malondialdehyde (MDA), but the reduction of glutathione to glutathione disulfide 
ratio. We also found that antioxidant N-﻿acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could ameliorate
CuONPs-induced oxidative stress and cell death. Interestingly, we demonstrated
that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was activated 
in CuONPs-treated HUVECs, while p38α MAPK knockdown by siRNA significantly
rescued HUVECs from CuONPs-induced DNA damage and cell death. Importantly, we
showed that copper ions chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) could alleviate
CuONPs-induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, p38 MAPK pathway activation and cell
death in HUVECs.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CuONPs induced oxidative DNA damage and cell
death via copper ions-mediated p38 MAPK activation in HUVECs, suggesting that the
release of copper ions was the upstream activator for CuONPs-induced vascular
endothelial toxicity, and the copper ions chelator TTM can alleviate
CuONPs-associated cardiovascular disease.

Hypoxia is a major obstacle to gastric cancer (GC) therapy and leads to
chemoresistance as GC cells are frequently exposed to the hypoxia environment.
Apigenin, a flavonoid found in traditional medicine, fruits, and vegetables and
an HDAC inhibitor, is a powerful anti-cancer agent against various cancer cell
lines. However, detailed mechanisms involved in the treatment of GC using APG are
not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the biological activity of
and molecular mechanisms involved in APG-mediated treatment of GC under hypoxia. 
APG promoted autophagic cell death by increasing ATG5, LC3-II, and
phosphorylation of AMPK and ULK1 and down-regulating p-mTOR and p62 in GC.
Furthermore, our results show that APG induces autophagic cell death via the
activation of the PERK signaling, indicating an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
response. The inhibition of ER stress suppressed APG-induced autophagy and
conferred prolonged cell survival, indicating autophagic cell death. We further
show that APG induces ER stress- and autophagy-related cell death through the
inhibition of HIF-1α and Ezh2 under normoxia and hypoxia. Taken together, our
findings indicate that APG activates autophagic cell death by inhibiting HIF-1α
and Ezh2 under hypoxia conditions in GC cells.

Suppression of ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) and stimulation of caspase-3
are involved in neurodegeneration. Can UPP activators and caspase-3 inhibitors
ameliorate neurodegeneration? Here, we found a novel neuronal cell death
accompanied with UPP activation and caspase-3 inhibition. Recently, plasmalemmal 
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) has been identified as one of membrane targets of
15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). 15d-PGJ2 induces neuronal apoptosis 
via activating caspase-3 and inactivating UPP, whereas the anti-NSE antibody
inactivated caspase-3, activated UPP, and caused neuronal cell death. The
anti-NSE antibody activated caspase-1 (pyroptosis marker), but not condense
chromatin (apoptosis marker). The anti-NSE antibody declined intracellular level 
of ATP, which is not altered in pyroptosis. The intracellular level of calcium is
elevated in necrosis and pyroptosis, but its chelator did not ameliorate the
neurotoxicity of anti-NSE. Thiol antioxidants such as N-acetyl cysteine and
glutathione reduced the neurotoxicity of 15d-PGJ2 but enhanced that of the
anti-NSE antibody. The anti-NSE antibody incorporated propidium iodide into
neurons through the disrupted plasma membrane, which are not observed in
ferroptosis and autophagic cell death. Thus, the anti-NSE antibody induced
neuronal cell death in a novel fashion distinguished from necrosis, necroptosis, 
apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagic cell death.

Cancer resistance to therapy is a big issue in cancer therapy. Tumours may
develop some mechanisms to reduce the induction of cell death, thus stimulating
tumour growth. Cancer cells may show a low expression and activity of tumour
suppressor genes and a low response to anti-tumour immunity. These mutations can 
increase the resistance of cancer cells to programmed cell death mechanisms such 
as apoptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagic cell death, and some others.
The upregulation of some mediators and transcription factors such as Akt, nuclear
factor of κB, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, Bcl-2, and
others can inhibit cell death in cancer cells. Using adjuvants to induce the
killing of cancer cells is an interesting strategy in cancer therapy. Nobiletin
(NOB) is a herbal-derived agent with fascinating anti-cancer properties. It has
been shown to induce the generation of endogenous ROS by cancer cells, leading to
damage to critical macromolecules and finally cell death. NOB may induce the
activity of p53 and pro-apoptosis mediators, and also inhibit the expression and 
nuclear translocation of anti-apoptosis mediators. In addition, NOB may induce
cancer cell killing by modulating other mechanisms that are involved in
programmed cell death mechanisms. This review aims to discuss the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of the programmed cell death in cancer by NOB via modulating
different types of cell death in cancer.

Cell death mechanisms are crucial to maintain an appropriate environment for the 
functionality of healthy cells. However, during viral infections, dysregulation
of these processes can be present and can participate in the pathogenetic
mechanisms of the disease. In this review, we describe some features of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and some immunopathogenic 
mechanisms characterizing the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Lymphopenia
and monocytopenia are important contributors to COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. The 
fine mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still unknown, and several
hypotheses have been raised, some of which assign a role to cell death as far as 
the reduction of specific types of immune cells is concerned. Thus, we discuss
three major pathways such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, and suggest 
that all of them likely occur simultaneously in COVID-19 patients. We describe
that SARS-CoV-2 can have both a direct and an indirect role in inducing cell
death. Indeed, on the one hand, cell death can be caused by the virus entry into 
cells, on the other, the excessive concentration of cytokines and chemokines, a
process that is known as a COVID-19-related cytokine storm, exerts deleterious
effects on circulating immune cells. However, the overall knowledge of these
mechanisms is still scarce and further studies are needed to delineate new
therapeutic strategies.

OBJECTIVES: The evolutionary conserved JNK pathway plays crucial role in cell
death, yet factors that modulate this signalling have not been fully disclosed.
In this study, we aim to identify additional factors that regulate JNK signalling
in cell death, and characterize the underlying mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila were raised on standard media, and cross was
carried out at 25°C. The Gal4/UAS system was used to express proteins or RNAi in 
a specific temporal and spatial pattern. Gene expression was revealed by GFP
fluorescence, X-gal staining or immunostaining of 3rd instar larval eye and wing 
discs. Cell death was visualized by acridine orange (AO) staining. Images of fly 
eyes and wings were taken by OLYMPUS microscopes.
RESULTS: We found that licorne (lic) encoding the Drosophila MKK3 is an essential
regulator of JNK-mediated cell death. Firstly, loss of lic suppressed ectopic
Egr-triggered JNK activation and cell death in eye and wing development.
Secondary, lic is necessary for loss-of-cell polarity-induced, physiological
JNK-dependent cell death in wing development. Thirdly, Lic overexpression is
sufficient to initiate JNK-mediated cell death in developing eyes and wings.
Furthermore, ectopic Lic activates JNK signalling by promoting JNK
phosphorylation. Finally, genetic epistatic analysis confirmed that Lic acts in
parallel with Hep in the Egr-JNK pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: This study not only identified Lic as a novel component of the JNK
signalling, but also disclosed the crucial roles and mechanism of Lic in cell
death.

The linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) is an essential component of the
innate and adaptive immune system. Modification of cellular substrates with
linear polyubiquitin chains is a key regulatory step in signal transduction that 
impacts cell death and inflammatory signaling downstream of various innate
immunity receptors. Loss-of-function mutations in the LUBAC components HOIP and
HOIL-1 yield a systemic autoinflammatory disease in humans, whereas their genetic
ablation is embryonically lethal in mice. Deficiency of the LUBAC adaptor protein
Sharpin results in a multi-organ inflammatory disease in mice characterized by
chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpdm), which is propagated by TNFR1-induced and
RIPK1-mediated keratinocyte cell death. We have previously shown that caspase-1
and -11 promoted the dermatitis pathology of cpdm mice and mediated cell death in
the skin. Here, we describe a reciprocal regulation of caspase-1 and LUBAC
activities in keratinocytes. We show that LUBAC interacted with caspase-1 via
HOIP and modified its CARD domain with linear polyubiquitin and that depletion of
HOIP or Sharpin resulted in heightened caspase-1 activation and cell death in
response to inflammasome activation, unlike what is observed in macrophages.
Reciprocally, caspase-1, as well as caspase-8, regulated LUBAC activity by
proteolytically processing HOIP at Asp-348 and Asp-387 during the execution of
cell death. HOIP processing impeded substrate ubiquitination in the NF-κB pathway
and resulted in enhanced apoptosis. These results highlight a regulatory
mechanism underlying efficient apoptosis in keratinocytes and provide further
evidence of a cross-talk between inflammatory and cell death pathways.

The brain is one of organs vulnerable to aluminum insult. Aluminum toxicity is
involved in neurobehavioral deficit, neuronal cell dysfunction, and death. The
aim of this study are as follows: (1) to evaluate the repairing efficiency of
Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a cell death inhibitor, and Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase
inhibitor, on Al-induced neurobehavioral deficit and neuronal cell death, in
order to evidence the cell death inducing ability of aluminum, and (2) to
primarily explore the possibility of treating neuronal cell loss-related disease,
such as Alzheimer's disease, with Nec-1 and Z-VAD in Al-induced dementia animal
model. We found Nec-1 and Z-VAD-FMK alone or in combination could reduce
aluminum-induced learning and memory impairment in mice. Pathohistological
results indicated that Nec-1 and Z-VAD-FMK can decrease Al-induced neuronal death
cell. In addition, some cell death-associated proteins in cell death signal
pathway were inhibited by Nec-1 and Z-VAD-FMK in Al-exposed mice. In conclusions,
Nec-1 and Z-VAD-FMK can repair the injury of learning and memory induced by
aluminum in mice. Furthermore, Nec-1 was more obvious to repair the injury of
learning and memory function compared with Z-VAD-FMK. Nec-1 and Z-VAD-FMK can
repair the Al-induced morphological injury of cell and reduce the amounts of dead
cell, and repairing effects were more significant at higher doses. The effect of 
Nec-1 was stronger than Z-VAD-FMK, though their mechanism was different. The
combination of them had the strongest effect. Our study evidenced Al-induced
neuronal necroptosis and apoptosis existing in animal model and suggested
potential therapeutic effects of Nec-1 and Z-VAD-FMK on neuronal cell death in
neurodegenerative diseases.

Cell death in the avian brain with emphasis on the development and plasticity of 
the song control system.

States. Electronic address: larson.tracy@virginia.edu.

Programmed cell death is a fundamental feature of brain development, homeostasis,
and adult plasticity. One model system, in which the role of cell death in
establishment, maintenance and plasticity of neural tissues is evident throughout
both early development and in the adult, is the neural circuitry underlying the
learning and production of singing behavior in songbirds. The dramatic sexual
dimorphism and natural, cyclical growth and regression of the song control system
provides a useful environment for studying programmed cell death. Especially
valuable and unique to songbirds, the occurrence of cell death in the song
control system is correlated to quantifiable changes in a biologically relevant
and learned sensorimotor behavior-that is singing. Within this review I explore
the topic of cell death in the avian brain primarily within the context of the
song circuits. I first establish why songbirds are a useful model for studying
cell death and provide a brief overview of the organization of the circuitry
underlying song learning and production. I then discuss the processes and
mechanisms of cell death during early development and sexual differentiation of
the song control system. I present the classic and recent work exploring cell
death in the adult avian brain by covering topics of homeostasis and neuronal
turnover, seasonal plasticity, and neural injury and insult. Finally, I propose
several outstanding questions in the field of cell death biology in the avian
brain, which when addressed have great potential to provide unique insight into
the role of cell death in the organization and maintenance of neural tissues, the
plasticity of developmentally organized neural circuits in the adult, and the
mechanisms underlying functional recovery from both natural and injury-induced
neurodegeneration.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by
CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Here, we examined the effects 
of antioxidants on 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP; a mitochondrial complex II
inhibitor)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in STHdhQ111 striatal
cells carrying homozygous mutant HTT with extended CAG repeats compared with
those in STHdhQ7 striatal cells. 3-NP reduced cell viability and increased cell
death both in STHdhQ111 and STHdhQ7, and the cytotoxicity was markedly attenuated
by antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine and edaravone). Furthermore, 3-NP increased 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both cell lines, and
this increase was inhibited by antioxidants. Mitochondrial ROS was also increased
by 3-NP in STHdhQ111 but not in STHdhQ7, and this increase was significantly
inhibited by edaravone. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was lower in
STHdhQ111 than that in STHdhQ7, and antioxidants prevented 3-NP-induced MMP
decrease in STHdhQ111.3-NP enhanced oligomerization of dynamin-related protein 1 
(Drp1), a protein that promotes mitochondrial fission in both cells, and both
antioxidants prevented the increase in oligomerization. These results suggest
that reduced mitochondrial complex II activity enhances cell death via
intracellular ROS production and Drp1 oligomerization in striatal cells with
mutant HTT and antioxidants may reduce striatal cell death.

5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors contribute to the exacerbation of targeted and
non-targeted effects of ionizing radiation-induced cell death in human colon
carcinoma cells.

Purpose: Serotonin (5-HT) is implicated in the underlying mechanisms which
mediate cell death following ionizing radiation exposure, however, effects appear
to be cell type-dependent. We sought to further characterize the role of 5-HT and
5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) in the exacerbation of cell death following ionizing
radiation exposure in human colon carcinoma cells.Materials and methods: We
examined the clonogenic survival of colon carcinoma HCT116 cells treated with
5-HT and the selective 5-HTR antagonists ketanserin (5-HT2A) and ondansetron
(5-HT3), following exposure to direct ionizing radiation and irradiated
cell-conditioned medium (ICCM). The relative expression of these target receptors
was measured using western blotting.Results: Western blotting results revealed
that relative protein levels of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors were similar. 5-HT
concentration-dependent increases in cell death that occurred following direct
ionizing radiation exposure were abolished by both 5-HTR antagonists. Death of
nonirradiated cells recipient of ICCM was increased in a concentration-dependent 
manner by 5-HT when present during donor cell irradiation. Both 5-HTR antagonists
completely abolished the increases in bystander-induced cell death generated by
5-HT. Finally, we show that exposure of cells to 5-HT prior to receipt of ICCM
can also dictate the degree of bystander-induced cell death.Conclusions: Our
findings demonstrate a definitive role for 5-HT in the exacerbation of cell death
following ionizing radiation exposure in colon carcinoma cells and highlight
5-HTRs as potential markers for predicting cellular radiosensitivity.

Lysosomes are degradative organelles essential for cell homeostasis. However,
various internal and external stimuli, including L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester 
(LLOMe), which is one of the common lysosomotropic agents, permeabilize the
lysosomal membrane, leading to lysosome-dependent cell death because of leakage
of lysosomal contents to the cytosol. The microphthalmia/transcription factor E
(MiT/TFE) family members, which include transcription factor EB (TFEB),
transcription factor E3 (TFE3), and microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor (MITF), are master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis and are known to be 
involved in the lysosomal stress response. However, their protective effects
against cell death associated with lysosomal-membrane damage are still poorly
understood. In this study, we confirmed that LLOMe-induced lysosomal damage
triggered nuclear translocation of TFEB/TFE3/MITF and increased the mRNA levels
of their target genes encoding lysosomal hydrolases and lysosomal membrane
proteins in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we revealed that TFEB/TFE3/MITF knockdown
exacerbated LLOMe-induced cell death. However, TFEB overexpression only slightly 
attenuated LLOMe-induced cell death, despite enhanced LLOMe-induced increase in
CTSD mRNA levels, implying that the endogenous levels of MiT/TFE family members
might be sufficient to promote lysosomal biogenesis in response to
lysosomal-membrane damage. Our results suggest that MiT/TFE family members
suppress the cell death associated with lysosomal-membrane damage.

Various types of cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and
ferroptosis, are induced in renal tubular epithelial cells following exposure to 
environmental stresses and toxicants such as osmotic stress, ischemia/reperfusion
injury, cisplatin, and cadmium. This is known to cause renal dysfunction, but the
cellular events preceding stress-induced cell death in renal tubules are not
fully elucidated. The activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 4/5, also known as
activin-transforming growth factor (TGF) β receptor, is involved in
stress-induced renal injury. We, therefore, studied the role of ALK4/5 signaling 
in HK-2 human proximal tubular epithelial cell death induced by cisplatin,
cadmium, hyperosmotic stress inducer, sorbitol, and the ferroptosis activator,
erastin. We found that ALK4/5 signaling is involved in cadmium- and
erastin-induced cell death, but not sorbitol- or cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell
death. Cadmium exposure elevated the level of phosphorylated Smad3, and treatment
with the ALK4/5 kinase inhibitors, SB431542 or SB505124, suppressed
cadmium-induced HK-2 cell death. Cadmium-induced cell death was attenuated by
siRNA-mediated ALK4 or Smad3 silencing, or by treatment with SIS3, a selective
inhibitor of TGFβ1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, ALK4/5 signaling
activated Akt signaling to promote cadmium-induced HK-2 cell death. In contrast, 
siRNA-mediated Inhibin-bA silencing or treatment with TGFβ1 or activin A had
little effect on cadmium-induced HK-2 cell death. On the other hand, treatment
with SB431542 or SB505124 attenuated erastin-induced ferroptosis by
hyperactivating Nrf2 signaling in HK-2 cells. These results suggest that blockade
of ALK4/5 signaling protects against cadmium- and erastin-induced HK-2 cell death
via Akt and Nrf2 signaling pathways, respectively.

The intestinal epithelium has one of the highest rates of cellular turnover in a 
process that is tightly regulated. As the transit-amplifying progenitors of the
intestinal epithelium generate ~300 cells per crypt every day, regulated cell
death and sloughing at the apical surface keeps the overall cell number in check.
An aberrant increase in the rate of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death
underlies instances of extensive epithelial erosion, which is characteristic of
several intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and infectious
colitis. Emerging evidence points to a crucial role of necroptosis, autophagy and
pyroptosis as important modes of programmed cell death in the intestine in
addition to apoptosis. The mode of cell death affects tissue restitution
responses and ultimately the long-term risks of intestinal fibrosis and
colorectal cancer. A vicious cycle of intestinal barrier breach, misregulated
cell death and subsequent inflammation is at the heart of chronic inflammatory
and infectious gastrointestinal diseases. This Review discusses the underlying
molecular and cellular underpinnings that control programmed cell death in IECs, 
which emerge during intestinal diseases. Translational aspects of cell death
modulation for the development of novel therapeutic alternatives for inflammatory
bowel diseases and colorectal cancer are also discussed.

Cell death plays a prominent role in the treatment of cancer, because most
anticancer therapies act by the induction of cell death including apoptosis,
necrosis, and other pathways of cell death. Imaging cell death helps to identify 
treatment responders from nonresponders and thus enables patient-tailored
therapy, which will increase the likelihood of treatment response and ultimately 
lead to improved patient survival. By taking advantage of molecular probes that
specifically target the biomarkers/biochemical processes of cell death, cell
death imaging can be successfully achieved. In recent years, with the increased
understanding of the molecular mechanism of cell death, a variety of well-defined
biomarkers/biochemical processes of cell death have been identified. By targeting
these established cell death biomarkers/biochemical processes, a set of molecular
imaging probes have been developed and evaluated for early monitoring treatment
response in tumors. In this review, we mainly present the recent advances in
identifying useful biomarkers/biochemical processes for both apoptosis and
necrosis imaging and in developing molecular imaging probes targeting these
biomarkers/biochemical processes, with a focus on their application in early
evaluation of tumor response to therapy.

The opportunistic human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus causes serious infectious 
diseases that range from superficial skin and soft tissue infections to
necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis. While classically regarded as an extracellular 
pathogen, S. aureus is able to invade and survive within human cells. Host cell
exit is associated with cell death, tissue destruction, and the spread of
infection. The exact molecular mechanism employed by S. aureus to escape the host
cell is still unclear. In this study, we performed a genome-wide small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) screen and identified the calcium signaling pathway as being involved
in intracellular infection. S. aureus induced a massive cytosolic Ca2+ increase
in epithelial host cells after invasion and intracellular replication of the
pathogen. This was paralleled by a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+
concentration. Additionally, calcium ions from the extracellular space
contributed to the cytosolic Ca2+ increase. As a consequence, we observed that
the cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise led to an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration,
the activation of calpains and caspases, and eventually to cell lysis of S.
aureus-infected cells. Our study therefore suggests that intracellular S. aureus 
disturbs the host cell Ca2+ homeostasis and induces cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload,
which results in both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in parallel or
succession.IMPORTANCE Despite being regarded as an extracellular bacterium, the
pathogen Staphylococcus aureus can invade and survive within human cells. The
intracellular niche is considered a hideout from the host immune system and
antibiotic treatment and allows bacterial proliferation. Subsequently, the
intracellular bacterium induces host cell death, which may facilitate the spread 
of infection and tissue destruction. So far, host cell factors exploited by
intracellular S. aureus to promote cell death are only poorly characterized. We
performed a genome-wide screen and found the calcium signaling pathway to play a 
role in S. aureus invasion and cytotoxicity. The intracellular bacterium induces 
a cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which results in host cell death. 
Thus, this study first showed how an intracellular bacterium perturbs the host
cell Ca2+ homeostasis.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) always leads to functional deterioration due to a series
of processes including cell death. In recent years, programmed cell death (PCD)
is considered to be a critical process after SCI, and various forms of PCD were
discovered in recent years, including apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy,
ferroptosis, pyroptosis and paraptosis. Unlike necrosis, PCD is known as an
active cell death mediated by a cascade of gene expression events, and it is
crucial for elimination unnecessary and damaged cells, as well as a defence
mechanism. Therefore, it would be meaningful to characterize the roles of PCD to 
not only enhance our understanding of the pathophysiological processes, but also 
improve functional recovery after SCI. This review will summarize and explore the
most recent advances on how apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis,
pyroptosis and paraptosis are involved in SCI. This review can help us to
understand the various functions of PCD in the pathological processes of SCI, and
contribute to our novel understanding of SCI of unknown aetiology in the near
future.

Litchi downy blight, caused by the phytopathogenic oomycete Peronophythora
litchii, results in tremendous economic loss in litchi production every year. To 
successfully colonize the host cell, Phytophthora species secret hundreds of RXLR
effectors that interfere with plant immunity and facilitate the infection
process. Previous work has already predicted 245 candidate RXLR effector-encoding
genes in P. litchii, 212 of which have been cloned and tested for plant cell
death-inducing activity in this study. We found three such RXLR effectors could
trigger plant cell death through transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana.
Further experiments demonstrated that PlAvh142 could induce cell death and immune
responses in several plants. We also found that PlAvh142 localized in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of plant cells. The cytoplasmic localization was critical
for its cell death-inducing activity. Moreover, deletion either of the two
internal repeats in PlAvh142 abolished the cell death-inducing activity.
Virus-induced gene silencing assays showed that cell death triggered by PlAvh142 
was dependent on the plant transduction components RAR1 (require for Mla12
resistance), SGT1 (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1) and HSP90 (heat shock
protein 90). Finally, knockout of PlAvh142 resulted in significantly attenuated
P. litchii virulence on litchi plants, whereas the PlAvh142-overexpressed mutants
were more aggressive. These data indicated that PlAvh142 could be recognized in
plant cytoplasm and is an important virulence RXLR effector of P. litchii.

Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), a calcium-permeable,
ubiquitously expressed ion channel, is critical for axonal development, and
mediates hypoxic and ischemic neuronal cell death in vitro and in vivo. However, 
the downstream mechanisms underlying the TRPM7-mediated processes in physiology
and pathophysiology remain unclear. In this study, we employed a mouse model of
hypoxic-ischemic brain cell death which mimics the pathophysiology of
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is a major public health issue and an 
important cause of neonatal deaths worldwide; however, the available treatments
for HIE remain limited. Its survivors face life-long neurological challenges
including mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and seizure disorders,
motor impairments, and visual and auditory impairments. Through a proteomic
analysis, we identified calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)
and phosphatase calcineurin as potential mediators of cell death downstream from 
TRPM7 activation. Further analysis revealed that TRPM7 mediates cell death
through CaMKII, calmodulin, calcineurin, p38, and cofilin cascade. In vivo, we
found a significant reduction of brain injury and improvement of short- and
long-term functional outcomes after HI after administration of specific TRPM7
blocker waixenicin A. Our data demonstrate a molecular mechanism of
TRPM7-mediated cell death and identifies TRPM7 as a promising therapeutic and
drug development target for HIE.

Ferroptosis was recently defined as a novel type of programmed cell death
depending on iron and lipid peroxidation. It is biologically different from other
types of cell death such as apoptosis. While the involvement of ferroptosis in
cancer, patient and animal model have been intensely studied, ferroptosis in
human motor neuron model is still clearly unknown. Here we carefully assessed
ferroptosis using human iPS cell-derived motor neuron (hiMNs). We found that
almost all hiMNs died by the treatment of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)
inhibitors. Importantly, the cell death was rescued by one antioxidant, vitamin E
acetate, iron chelators and lipid peroxidase inhibitors with high dynamic ranges.
Finally, these data clearly indicated that ferroptosis constitutively occurs in
hiMNs, suggesting the possibility that it might play a biologically and
pathologically important roles in motor neuron death such as motor neuron disease
(MND)/Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Lethal small molecules are useful probes to discover and characterize novel cell 
death pathways and biochemical mechanisms. Here we report that the synthetic
oxime-containing small molecule caspase-independent lethal 56 (CIL56) induces an 
unconventional form of nonapoptotic cell death distinct from necroptosis,
ferroptosis, and other pathways. CIL56-induced cell death requires a
catalytically active protein S-acyltransferase complex comprising the enzyme
ZDHHC5 and an accessory subunit GOLGA7. The ZDHHC5-GOLGA7 complex is mutually
stabilizing and localizes to the plasma membrane. CIL56 inhibits anterograde
protein transport from the Golgi apparatus, which may be lethal in the context of
ongoing ZDHHC5-GOLGA7 complex-dependent retrograde protein trafficking from the
plasma membrane to internal sites. Other oxime-containing small molecules,
structurally distinct from CIL56, may trigger cell death through the same
pathway. These results define an unconventional form of nonapoptotic cell death
regulated by protein S-acylation.

Cytotoxic T cell-induced cell death is well documented. Cytotoxic T cell releases
various cytolytic proteins. The cytolytic proteins induce target cell death. T
cell-induced cell death can be measured by the lytic assay. One of the well-known
lytic assays uses radioactive tracer, Chromium-51 (51Cr), and detects the amount 
of 51Cr released from target cells. This assay can detect cell death and the
efficiency of the T cell-induced cell death by coculture effector cells (T cells)
and target cells. This assay can determine the kinetics of the cell lysis. The
issue of this approach is the use of radioactive material. This chapter describes
measuring T cell-induced cell death by determining the epigenetic remodeling and 
the release of cytolytic proteins. Determine the efficiency of T cell-induced
cell death by using a flow cytometry-based detection method.

Podocytopathies are kidney diseases that are driven by podocyte injury with
proteinuria and proteinuria-related symptoms as the main clinical presentations. 
Albeit podocytopathies are the major contributors to end-stage kidney disease,
the underlying molecular mechanisms of podocyte injury remain to be elucidated.
Mitochondrial oxidative stress is associated with kidney diseases, and increasing
evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of
podocytopathies. Accumulating evidence has placed mitochondrial oxidative stress 
in the focus of cell death research. Excessive generated reactive oxygen species 
over antioxidant defense under pathological conditions lead to oxidative damage
to cellular components and regulate cell death in the podocyte. Conversely,
exogenous antioxidants can protect podocyte from cell death. This review provides
an overview of the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in podocytopathies and 
discusses its role in the cell death of the podocyte, aiming to identify the
novel targets to improve the treatment of patients with podocytopathies.

Cadmium (Cd2+ ) is highly harmful to plant growth. Although Cd2+ induces
programmed cell death (PCD) in plant cells, Cd2+ stress in whole plants during
later developmental stages and the mechanism underlying Cd2+ -mediated toxicity
are poorly understood. Here, we showed that Cd2+ limits plant growth, causes
intense redness in leaf vein, leaf yellowing, and chlorosis during the R1
reproductive stage of soybean (Glycine max). These symptoms were associated with 
Cd2+ -induced PCD, as Cd2+ -stressed soybean leaves displayed decreased number of
nuclei, enhanced cell death, DNA damage, and caspase 1 activity compared to
unstressed leaves. Accordingly, Cd2+ -induced NRPs, GmNAC81, GmNAC30 and VPE, the
DCD/NRP-mediated cell death signalling components, which execute PCD via caspase 
1-like VPE activity. Furthermore, overexpression of the positive regulator of
this cell death signalling GmNAC81 enhanced sensitivity to Cd2+ stress and
intensified the hallmarks of Cd2+ -mediated PCD. GmNAC81 overexpression enhanced 
Cd2+ -induced H2 O2 production, cell death, DNA damage, and caspase-1-like VPE
expression. Conversely, BiP overexpression negatively regulated the
NRPs/GmNACs/VPE signalling module, conferred tolerance to Cd2+ stress and reduced
Cd2+ -mediated cell death. Collectively, our data indicate that Cd2+ induces PCD 
in plants via activation of the NRP/GmNAC/VPE regulatory circuit that links
developmentally and stress-induced cell death.

Rupture of aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) remains a leading cause of death.
Progressive smooth muscle cell (SMC) loss is a crucial feature of AAD that
contributes to aortic dysfunction and degeneration, leading to aortic aneurysm,
dissection, and, ultimately, rupture. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of
SMC loss and identifying pathways that promote SMC death in AAD are critical for 
developing an effective pharmacologic therapy to prevent aortic destruction and
disease progression. Cell death is controlled by programmed cell death pathways, 
including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. Although these
pathways share common stimuli and triggers, each type of programmed cell death
has unique features and activation pathways. A growing body of evidence supports 
a critical role for programmed cell death in the pathogenesis of AAD, and
inhibitors of various types of programmed cell death represent a promising
therapeutic strategy. This review discusses the different types of programmed
cell death pathways and their features, induction, contributions to AAD
development, and therapeutic potential. We also highlight the clinical
significance of programmed cell death for further studies.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease and severe neural
complications in infants and young children. Viral pathogenesis is associated
with virus-induced cell death and inflammatory cytokine production, which is
usually correlated with the type of programmed cell death. EV71-infected cells
were analyzed through microscopy, cell staining, and immunoblotting to determine 
the characteristics of EV71-induced cell death. Results demonstrated that EV71
infection induced cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, decreased mitochondrial
potential, and membrane phosphatidylserine translocation. Caspase-9 activation,
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and lactate dehydrogenase release were
also observed during virus-induced cell death. The activated gasdermin D (GSDMD) 
and the phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (p-MLKL) were not
detected. These observations indicated that EV71-induced cell death was mainly
executed by apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway rather than by GSDMD-mediated
pyroptosis and p-MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Genome scanning analysis identified
that EV71 2A, 2B, and 3C might be the determinant genes of virus-induced cell
death. Further experiments showed that EV71 2A- and 3C-induced cell death
exhibited dependence on their protease activities but involved different
mechanisms. EV71 2A-induced cell death was correlated with the shut-off of host
cap-dependent translation, whereas EV71 3C-induced cell death might not be
ascribed to this mechanism. These findings would enhance our understanding of
EV71 infection and viral pathogenesis, and help identify antiviral targets.

From previous investigations it has been shown that there exists
healthy-appearing articular cartilage that contains collagen fibril network
destructuring. It is hypothesised that such sub-micron scale destructuring not
only presents an increased vulnerability to tissue scale damage following impact 
loading, but an increase in cell death as well. Cartilage-on-bone blocks from 12 
patellae, six healthy (G0) and the other six with sub-micron fibrillar
destructuring (G1), were obtained and subject to 2.3 J impact loading. Two sets
of sub-samples were obtained for each block tested. One set was used to examine
for the live/dead cell response using calcein-AM and propidium iodide staining,
imaged with confocal microscopy. The tissue microstructural matrix was imaged
from the other matched set, unstained and in its fully hydrated state, using
differential interference contrast optical light microscopy. High speed imaging
of the impact was used to calculate the velocity changes or coefficient of
restitution (COR) and used as a proxy of energy that the tissue absorbed. A
previously defined tissue matrix damage score was used to quantify the extent of 
fracturing and cracking in the matrix. The cell death (PCD) was counted and
presented as a percentage against all cells live plus dead. The energy absorbed
was 36.5% higher in G1 than in G0 (p = 0.034). However, the damage score and PCD 
of samples in the G1 group was much larger than the G0 group, ~300% and 161%
respectively. Microscopy showed that cell death is associated to both matrix
compaction and further fibrillar destructuring from the ECM to the territorial
matrix regions of the chondron. Following impact loading, cartilage tissue that
appears normal but contains sub-micron fibrillar matrix destructuring responds
with significantly increased cell death.
